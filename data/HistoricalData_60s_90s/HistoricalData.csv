ROCKS OF THE FOLD BELT ARE  THRUST TO THE EAST AND DISPLAY INCREASING DEFORMATION AND METAMORPHISM  WESTWARD.  ALMOST ALL THE PHOSPHATE DEPOSITS ARE FOUND IN THE BRASILIA FOLD BELT  EITHER ALONG ITS BOUNDARY WITH THE CRATON OR IN EXTERNAL STRUCTURAL  UNITS SHOWING POLYCYCLIC DEFORMATION AND GREEN-SCHIST METAMORPHISM. THEY  OCCUR IN THE METASEDIMENTARY ROCKS OF THE MIDDLE PROTEROZOIC PARANOA  GROUP AND IN THE UPPER PROTEROZOIC SAO FRANCISCO GROUP AND ITS  EQUIVALENTS. MIDDLE PROTEROZOIC PHOSPHORITES ARE ECONOMICALLY THE MORE  IMPORTANT MOST ARE SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A  STROMATOLITE REEF BARRIER. HOWEVER THE ROCINHA-PATOS DE MINAS DEPOSIT  THE ONLY PRESENTLY MINED IS LOCATED SOUTH OF THE REEF BARRIER. IT HAS  DEVELOPED ON A SHALLOW TO DEEP RAMP BETWEEN A WIDE INTERNAL BASIN WITH  REDUCED OXYGEN CONDITIONS AND LIMITED DETRITUS AND A MORE OXYGENATED  MARINE ENVIRONMENT TO THE WEST.  IN THE ROCINHA MINE PHOSPHATE FORMS GRAINS ANGULAR FRAGMENTS LENSES  OR CENTIMETER-THICK BEDS IN SCHISTS AND CARBONATE OR GLAUCONITIC  SCHISTS. THE P2O5 CONTENT OF PHOSPHATIC ROCKS RANGES BETWEEN 10 AND 15  PERCENT. ANNUAL PRODUCTION IS AROUND 200000 TONS OF ORE CONTAINING 24  PERCENT P2O5. THE MINE AREA COMPRISES FOUR TECTONIC SLICES MADE UP OF  SCHISTS QUARTZOSCHISTS AND PHOSPHATIC SCHISTS SEPARATED BY  SUBHORIZONTAL SHEAR PLANES. THESE ARE DEFINED BY TECTONIC BRECCIAS IN  WHICH SECONDARY APATITE HAS RECRYSTALLIZED. THE MINE IS EXPOSED IN A 50-  TO 75-M PHOSPHATIC SEQUENCE WHICH IS REPEATED IN A LOWER SLICE ABOUT 100  M BELOW MINE LEVEL.  THE PHOSPHATIC ORE IS A HOMOGENEOUS CRYPTO- TO MICROCRYSTALLINE APATITE  IN FAIRLY CONTINUOUS CENTIMETER-THICK BEDS WHICH WERE STRETCHED  FRAGMENTED AND BOUDINAGED DURING BRASILIANO ISOCLINAL FOLDING AND  SUBSEQUENT SUBHORIZONTAL SHEARING.  X-RAY DIFFRACTION IR SPECTROMETRY AND CHEMICAL ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT  THE METASEDIMENTARY PHOSPHATE IS A WEAKLY CARBONATED FLUORAPATITE WITH  LOW F AND CO2 CONTENTS. THE INFLUENCE OF THE BRASILIANO OROGENESIS IS  MARKED BY PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION OF F BY OH. SECONDARY PRISMATIC APATITE  KAOLINITE COATINGS AND WAVELLITE SHEAFLIKE STRUCTURES ARE PRODUCTS OF  WEATHERING AND ARE FOUND IN MINE SECTIONS AND BORE HOLES TO A DEPTH OF  10 TO 15 M.

SIGHTINGS OF ONE TO THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE MADE ON ELEVEN  OCCASIONS IN INSHORE WATERS PROTECTED BY REEFS AND AT THE OFFSHORE SIDES  OF REEFS. MANATEES WERE ONLY OBSERVED IN MARCH AND APRIL. POSSIBLE  MOVEMENTS BETWEEN SEA AND INSHORE WATERS COULD INCIDATE A NEED FOR  FRESHWATER AND/OR BE RELATED TO FORAGING PREFERENCES AND MIGRATION.  DIRECT THREATS TO MANATEE SURVIVAL IN THE STATE OF PARAIBA INCLUDE  HUNTING AND ACCIDENTAL CATCHES. DEGRADATION OF SUITABLE HABITAT MIGHT  ALSO INCREASE MANATEE VULNERABILITY IN BARRA DE MAMANGUAPE.

FAUNAL LISTS CORRECTED FOR SYNONYMIES VARIANT GENERIC COMBINATIONS AND  MISIDENTIFICATIONS WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE DATABASE FOR EIGHT AREAS IN  THE TROPICAL WESTERN ATLANTIC. THESE ARE EASTERN AND WESTERN FLORIDA  YUCATAN PANAMA JAMAICA PUERTO RICO THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES AND  NORTHERN BRAZIL. TO CORRECT FOR REGIONAL COLLECTING BIASES SPECIES  SMALLER THAN 5 MM THOSE OCCURRING ONLY DEEPER THAN 50 METERS AND THOSE  LACKING EXTERNAL SHELLS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE LISTS. IN 28 PAIRWISE  COMPARISONS AMONG THE STANDARDIZED LISTS 27 SHOWED FAUNAL SIMILARITIES  GREATER THAN 50\%. WESTERN FLORIDA WHICH LACKS SHALLOW REEFAL HABITATS  HAD FAUNAL SIMILARITIES LOWER THAN DID EASTERN FLORIDA WHICH HAS THESE  HABITATS. HABITAT AVAILABILITY SEEMS AS IMPORTANT AS GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE  IN DETERMINING FAUNAL SIMILARITY WITHIN THE TROPICAL WESTERN ATLANTIC.  NONE OF THE EIGHT REGIONS HAD MORE THAN 4\% ENDEMIC SPECIES.

THE EARLIEST  GONORYNCHIFORMS OCCURRED IN THE CRETACEOUS OF BRAZIL AND WEST AFRICA.  CHANOS OCCURRED IN THE FRESHWATER EOCENE DEPOSITS OF EUROPE AND NORTH  AMERICA AND PROBABLY INVADED THE CIRCUMTROPICAL TETHYS SEA DURING  TRANSGRESSION EPISODES. AT PRESENT MILKFISH OCCURS NEAR CONTINENTAL  SHELVES AND AROUND OCEANIC ISLANDS THROUGHOUT THE TROPICAL INDO-PACIFIC.  MILKFISH POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE RANGE SHOW HIGH GENETIC VARIATION  BUT LOW GENETIC DIVERGENCE SIMILAR TO MANY OTHER COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT  TELEOSTS. THE NATURAL LIFE HISTORY OF MILKFISH IS ONE OF CONTINUAL  MIGRATION. ADULTS ARE RELATIVELY LARGE TO 1.5 M OR 15 KG LONG-LIVED  TO 15 YEARS PELAGIC AND SCHOOLING. THEY SPAWN OFFSHORE NEAR CORAL  REEFS OR SMALL ISLANDS. THE EGGS EMBRYOS AND LARVAE ARE PELAGIC AND  RELATIVELY LARGER THAN THOSE OF MOST MARINE SPECIES. LARVAE GREATER THAN  OR EQUAL TO 10 MM LONG AND 2-3 WEEKS OLD MOVE INSHORE VIA A COMBINATION  OF PASSIVE ADVECTION AND ACTIVE MIGRATION. PASSING SHORE WATERS AND SURF  ZONES THEY SETTLE IN SHALLOW-WATER DEPOSITIONAL HABITATS SUCH AS  MANGROVE SWAMPS AND CORAL LAGOONS WHERE THEY METAMORPHOSE AND SPEND A  FEW MONTHS AS JUVENILES. SOME JUVENILES MAY ENTER FRESHWATER LAKES WHERE  THEY GROW INTO SUB-ADULTS BUT DO NOT MATURE. BOTH SMALL JUVENILES AND  LARGE SUB-ADULTS GO BACK TO SEA WHEN THEY REACH THE SIZE LIMIT  SUPPORTABLE BY THE HABITAT. LITTLE ELSE IS KNOWN OF THE DYNAMICS OF WILD  POPULATIONS OF MILKFISH. A FISHERY ON INSHORE LARVAE SUPPORTS THE  CENTURIES-OLD AQUACULTURE OF MILKFISH IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. DURING THE PAST  TEN YEARS MILKFISH HAVE MATURED AND SPAWNED UNDER VARIOUS CONDITIONS OF  CAPTIVITY AND HATCHERIES HAVE PRODUCED LARVAE TO SUPPLY THE CULTURE  PONDS.

MEAN TOTAL CATCH KG H-1 DECREASED 6-FOLD AND THE NUMBER OF  SPECIES BY MORE THAN HALF ALONG THE DEPTH RANGE WITH A SHARP STEP AT  350 M. BOTH CATCH AND NUMBER OF SPECIES WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN THE  WINTER CRUISES. MOST SPECIES OCCURRED IN BOTH WINTER AND SUMMER-AUTUMN  CRUISES BUT WITH INCREASING DEPTH THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF SPECIES  THAT OCCUR YEAR-ROUND DECREASED WHEREAS FISHES THAT OCCUR MOSTLY IN  WINTER INCREASED.

S.W. AUSTRALIA  SOUTH AFRICA AND ON ST. HELENA DURING THE BEAGLE'S EXTENDED VOYAGE  1831-1836.  THE SUBSIDENCE THEORY OF ATOLLS BASED ON STUDIES OF CAPT. FITZROY'S  NAVY CHARTS WAS FORMULATED ALREADY BEFORE REACHING RECIFE AND THE  CRUSTAL UPLIFT IN PATAGONIA OFFERED A PERFECTLY LOGICAL CONTRAST TO  PACIFIC SUBSIDENCE THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO THE CONCEPT OF  `'TECTONO-EUSTASY''. ALTHOUGH A DECADE OR SO BEFORE CHARPENTIER AGASSIZ  AND GEIKIE THE ICE-AGE GLACIATION MUST HAVE BEEN CLEARLY IMPLANTED IN  DARWIN'S MIND FOR HE ALSO REASONED ON THE ASSUMPTION OF ITS HYDROLOGIC  IMPLICATIONS NOW KNOWN AS `'GLACIO-EUSTASY''.  DARWIN REPEATEDLY OBSERVED LIME-CEMENTED SANDSTONES LATER TO BE CALLED  `'EOLIAN CALCARENITES'' BY GRABAU AND `'EOLIANITES'' BY SAYLES IN  COASTAL SETTINGS. THEIR STEEP DIPS AND BEDDING ORIENTATION SUGGESTED  WIND-BORNE ''AEOLIAN'' TRANSPORT FROM SEAWARD FROM A CONTINENTAL OR  INSULAR SHELF NOW INUNDATED BY WHAT - HE REASONED - WAS A RISE OF SEA  LEVEL OR SINKING OF THE LAND. DARWIN'S OBSERVATIONS OF EOLIANITES AT  KING GEORGE'S SOUND IN SOUTHWESTERN AUSTRALIA IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE  VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE MARCH 1836 MAY PERHAPS HAVE BEEN THE FINAL  `'CRUCIAL EXPERIMENT'' THAT CONVINCED HIM OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT THE  WORLDWIDE NATURE OF EUSTASY.,FAIRBRIDGE RW 1995 CARBONATES EVAPORITES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Could not access the paper

MOST PARASITE SPECIES EXHIBITED A CLUSTERED DISTRIBUTION IN THE  HOST POPULATIONS AS MEASURED BY VARIANCE TO MEAN RATIOS I.E. SOME FISH  WERE MORE AND OTHERS LESS HEAVILY INFECTED THAN IF INFECTION WERE  RANDOM. CORE AND SATELLITE SPECIES CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED  UNAMBIGUOUSLY BECAUSE NUMBERS OF PARASITES ON ALMOST ALL HOSTS ARE TOO  SMALL FOR ANY BIMODALITY TO BECOME APPARENT. ON AVERAGE THE MOST  DOMINANT SPECIES REPRESENTED 90\% OF ALL PARASITE INDIVIDUALS OF A  PARTICULAR FISH DIFFERENT PARASITE SPECIES WERE OFTEN DOMINANT ON  DIFFERENT FISH INDIVIDUALS OF A PARTICULAR HOST SPECIES. BOTH ABUNDANCES  AND MAXIMUM INTENSITIES OF INFECTION WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH  PREVALENCE OF INFECTION.

SPECIES  RICHNESS ABUNDANCE AND PREVALENCE OF INFECTION IN MANY FISH GROUPS  WITH DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH  TEMPERATURE.

KARNER GD 1997 MAR PET GEOL,1997,TECTONIC SIGNIFICANCE OF SYN-RIFT SEDIMENT PACKAGES ACROSS THE  GABON-CABINDA CONTINENTAL MARGIN,QUANTITATIVE BASIN MODELLING RIFT TECTONICS SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY LITHOSPHERIC FLEXURE BASINS EVOLUTION LITHOSPHERE EXTENSION DEPOSITS MODELS,THE TECTONIC DEVELOPMENT OF A CONTINENTAL MARGIN IS RECORDED IN THE  STRATIGRAPHIC SUCCESSIONS PRESERVED ALONG AND ACROSS THE MARGIN IN TERMS  OF STRATAL RELATIONSHIPS E.G. ONLAP DOWNLAP TRUNCATION  LITHOFACIES BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND PALEO-WATER DEPTHS. BY USING THESE  OBSERVATIONS COUPLED TO A KINEMATIC AND FLEXURAL MODEL FOR THE  DEFORMATION OF THE LITHOSPHERE WE HAVE ELUCIDATED THE TECTONIC  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRESERVED STRATIGRAPHY THAT COMPRISES THE  GABON-CABINDA MARGIN OF WEST AFRICA. TWO HINGE ZONES AN EASTERN AND  ATLANTIC FORMED ALONG THE GABAN-CABINDA MARGIN IN RESPONSE TO THREE  DISCRETE EXTENSIONAL EVENTS OCCURRING FROM BERRIASIAN TO APTIAN TIME.  THE EASTERN HINGE ZONE DEMARCATES THE EASTERN LIMIT OF A BROADLY  DISTRIBUTED BERRIASIAN EXTENSION THAT RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF DEEP  ANOXIC LACUSTRINE SYSTEMS AS EVIDENCED BY THE SILTS AND SHALES OF THE  SIALIVAKOU AND LOWER DJENO FORMATIONS AND THE REGRESSIVE PACKAGES OF THE  UPPER DJENO FORMATION. APPROXIMATELY 1.5 TO 2 KM OF ASYMMETRIC FOOTWALL  UPLIFT WAS INDUCED ACROSS THE EASTERN HINGE ZONE IN RESPONSE TO THE  MECHANICAL UNLOADING OF THE LITHOSPHERE DURING THIS FIRST PHASE OF  RIFTING. IN CONTRAST THE ATLANTIC HINGE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 90 KM  WEST OF THE EASTERN HINGE MARKS THE EASTERN LIMIT OF A SECOND PHASE OF  EXTENSION THAT BEGAN IN THE HAUTERIVIAN. FOOTWALL UPLIFT AND ROTATION  EXPOSED EARLIER SYN-RIFT AND PRE-RIFT SEDIMENTS TO AT LEAST WAVEBASE  CAUSING VARYING AMOUNTS OF EROSIONAL TRUNCATION ACROSS THE ATLANTIC  HINGE ZONE ALONG MUCH OF THE GABON-CABINDA MARGINS. WE INTERPRET THE  THICKNESS VARIATIONS OF REWORKED ELASTIC SEDIMENT OF THIS AGE E.G. THE  MELANIA FORMATION BETWEEN THE HINGE ZONES AS INDICATIVE OF VARIATIONS  IN THE DEGREE OF UPLIFT AND EROSIONAL TRUNCATION OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE.  FOR EXAMPLE THE ABSENCE OF MELANIA FORMATION ACROSS THE CONGO MARGIN  IMPLIES THAT UPLIFT OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE WAS RELATIVELY MINOR COMPARED  TO THAT ACROSS THE CABINDA AND GABON MARGINS THE LATTER BEING  CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT THICKNESSES OF MELANIA FORMATION OR  EQUIVALENT. MATERIAL ERODED FROM THE CABINDA AND GABON ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONE MAY IN PART ACCOUNT FOR THE THICK WEDGE OF SEDIMENT DEPOSITED  SEAWARD OF THE GABON-CABINDA ATLANTIC HINGE THE ERVA FORMATION. OUR  MODELLING SUGGESTS THAT THIS WEDGE OF REWORKED ELASTICS REPRESENTS  DEPOSITION BY ALONG-AXIS GRAVITY FLOWS WITHIN A DEEP WATER APPROXIMATE  TO 2 KM ENVIRONMENT. A THIRD AND FINAL PHASE OF EXTENSION IN THE LATE  BARREMIAN-EARLY APTIAN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BREACHING THE CONTINENTAL  LITHOSPHERE TO FARM THE OCEAN/CONTINENT BOUNDARY AND THUS THE  INSTALLATION OF OPEN MARINE CONDITIONS. ELSEWHERE THE ENVIRONMENTS WILL  TEND TO BE MARGINAL MARINE TO BRACKISH DEPENDING ON THE EFFICIENCY OF  THE ATLANTIC HINGE ZONE TO ACT AS A BARRIER TO MARINE ENCHROACHMENT.  THIS THIRD RIFT PHASE REACTIVATED BOTH THE EASTERN AND ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONES THEREBY CREATING ACCOMMODATION FOR THE MARNES NOIRES FORMATION  AND EQUIVALENT SOURCE ROCK DEPOSITION BETWEEN THE HINGES AND THE  FALCAO SOURCE ROCK EQUIVALENT SEAWARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE. TWO  POSSIBLE SCENARIOS EXIST FOR THE LATERAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE MARNES  NOIRES FORMATION IF THE REACTIVATED RIFT FLANK TOPOGRAPHY ACROSS THE  ATLANTIC HINGE WAS SIGNIFICANT THEN SEDIMENTATION WOULD BE RESTRICTED  BETWEEN THE HINGE ZONES WITHIN DISCRETE LACUSTRINE SETTINGS E.G. CONGO  MARGIN ALTERNATIVELY IF HINGE ZONE UPLIFT WAS RELATIVELY MINOR THEN  A CORAL-RIMMED ARCHIPELAGO MAY HAVE DEVELOPED PARALLEL TO THE MARGIN  WITH RESTRICTED COMMUNICATION ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HINGE ZONE E.G.   CABINDA MARGIN IN THIS LATTER SCENARIO DILUTION OF THE MARNES  NOIRES SOURCE ROCKS BY TERRIGENOUS INPUT FROM THE ERODING ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONE SHOULD BE RELATIVELY MINOR THEREBY ENHANCING SOURCE ROCK QUALITY  FURTHERMORE POTENTIAL MARINE UPWELLING OUTBOARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONE IS LIKELY THE CAUSE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND ACCUMULATION OF  ORGANIC-RICH MATERIAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE FALCAO SOURCE ROCK OF THE  KWANZA BASIN. BY LATE APTIAN TIME THE REMAINING ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN  THE HINGE ZONES WAS PARTIALLY FILLED BY ACROSS-AND ALONG-AXIS PROGRADING  DELTAIC SYSTEMS OF THE ARGILLES VERTES AND TCHIBOTA FORMATIONS. THE  PROGRADATION AND INTERACTION OF THE ARGILLES VERTES DEPOSITIONAL LOBES  RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF RESIDUAL PALEO-RELIEF. SUBSEQUENT MARINE  INCURSIONS AND FLOODING OF THIS PALEO-RELIEF LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF  BASAL CONGLOMERATES THE CHELA `LAG' UNCONFORMITY GRADING UPWARD INTO  FINE-GRAINED SANDS AND EVAPORITES CONSEQUENTLY AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP  SHOULD EXIST BETWEEN EVAPORITE THICKNESS IN PARTICULAR THE LOWER  MEMBERS AND THE THICKNESS OF THE UNDERLYING ARGILLES VERTES AND  TCHIBOTA FORMATIONS. VARIATIONS IN LOEME EVAPORITE THICKNESS IS A  CONSEQUENCE OF STRATIGRAPHIC AND STRUCTURAL CONTROL WITH SALT  INSTABILITY INFLUENCING LOCAL VARIABILITY  OUR MODELING SUGGESTS THE OCCURRENCE OF TWO DISTINCT EVAPORITE SEQUENCES  ON THE CONGO MARGIN AN EARLIER EVAPORITE DEPOSITED SEAWARD WEST OF  THE ATLANTIC HINGE DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD RIFT PHASES AND THE LATE  APTIAN LOEME FORMATION DEPOSITED BETWEEN THE HINGE ZONES. AN EVAPORITE  SEQUENCE SEAWARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE IS INFERRED ON THE BASIS OF  EXTENSIVE DIAPIRS AND SALT TECTONIC STRUCTURES OBSERVED IN SEISMIC DATA.  IN ORDER TO MATCH THE DISTRIBUTION AND THICKNESS OF THE OBSERVED  POST-SALT STRATIGRAPHY ACROSS THE BASIN HOWEVER WE REQUIRE LARGE  PALEOWATER DEPTHS WEST OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE DURING THE LATER APTIAN  THE EXISTENCE OF LARGE PALEOWATER DEPTHS PRECLUDES THE FORMATION OF  THICK EVAPORITE SEQUENCES WITHIN THE OUTER BASIN CONSEQUENTLY WE  PROPOSE THAT THE EVAPORITES SEAWARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE WERE FORMED  DURING THE SYN-RIFT DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARGIN AND ARE NOT  CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THE POST-RIFT LOEME SALTS DEPOSITED BETWEEN THE  HINGE ZONES.

DATA PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER  SHOW AN INVERSE CORRELATION BETWEEN PRECIPITATION IN THE SAHEL AND THE  DELTA18O VALUES OF A CORAL SKELETONS OF THE SPECIES SIDERASTREA SPP.  COLLECTED FROM THE ISLAND OF PRINCIPE IN THE GULF OF GUINEA. THIS IS  OPPOSITE TO THE CORRELATION EXPECTED AS PREVIOUS WORK HAS SUGGESTED  THAT HIGHER SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES OCCUR IN THE GULF OF GUINEA DURING  PERIODS OF LOW RAINFALL IN THE SAHEL. SUCH AN ASSOCIATION WOULD LEAD TO  A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SAHEL PRECIPITATION AND SKELETAL  DELTA18O. THE EXPLANATION FOR THE OBSERVED INVERSE CORRELATION IS THAT  THE SALINITY OF THE GULF OF GUINEA IS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE OUTFLOW  FROM THE NIGER AND CONGO RIVERS. THESE PERIODS OF HIGH FRESHWATER INPUT  ALSO CORRELATE WITH PERIODS OF HIGHER RAINFALL IN THE SUB-SAHARA AND  THEREFORE AFFECT THE DELTA18O VALUES OF THE CORAL SKELETON.

THESE ARE TAKEN FROM BLOCKS  EXCAVATED ACROSS A REEF-FRONT/ REEF-CREST/ REEF-FLAT SECTION IN THE  WINDWARD TRANSECT AND A REEF-CREST / REEF-FLAT SECTION IN THE LEEWARD  TRANSECT. THE MAIN SUBSTRATE AVAILABLE FOR ENCRUSTATION IS THE DOMINANT  PRIMARY FRAMEWORKING-BUILDING CORALLINE ALGA POROLITHON CF PACHYDERMUM.

VERMETID GASTROPODS AND HOMOTREMATID AND ACERVULINID  FORAMINIFERANS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SECONDARY FRAMEWORK BUILDERS IN  THE SURVEYED REEFS.

In the central western Atlantic it supports commercially important fisheries in three geographically separate areas: the eastern Caribbean islands; the southern Netherlands Antilles; and northeast Brazil, although the resource remains unmanaged in all three areas and the stock structure unresolved. Previous tagging studies of H. affinis, in the central western Atlantic indicated very little about the movements of flyingfish off northeastern Brazil, but did show that flyingfish move freely between the eastern Caribbean islands, although they do not appear to travel as far as the southern Netherlands Antilles. However, tagging studies only address geographical movement of fish and cannot discriminate among genetically discrete stocks. In this study, we use mtDNA markers (restriction fragment length polymorphisms [RFLPs] of the D-loop region) to examine the genetic variation and its implication for the stock structure of flyingfish across the central western Atlantic. A total of 360 flyingfish were sampled from the commercial fisheries in the three geographical areas between January and August 1995. Sixty fish were taken from each of the two spawning populations in Barbados and 60 from the spawning populations in each of Dominica and Tobago (in the eastern Caribbean); 60 from Curaçao (in the southern Netherlands Antilles); and 60 from Caiçara (in Rio Grande do Norte, northeast Brazil). The mtDNA D-loop region was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and digested to produce RFLPs using five restriction enzymes. Extensive genetic diversity was observed, with distinct composite mitotypes being detected for each of the three geographical areas, indicating a lack of gene flow between these areas and the existence of at least three unit stocks of H. affinis in the central western Atlantic. The results of cluster analyses of composite mitotype sequence divergence and population sequence divergence, and parsimony analysis of composite mitotypes were entirely consistent with a 3-stock model. Furthermore, genetic heterogeneity was detected among eastern Caribbean populations indicating restricted gene flow even within a sub-region and emphasizing the need for more detailed studies of flyingfish spawning behaviour. These results contrast with the typically low levels of genetic variation reported for oceanic pelagic species, and for other marine species (reef fish, spiny lobster, queen conch) in the Caribbean and indicate that major ocean current patterns are not good predictors of gene flow for all species. The implications for management of the flyingfish resource in the central western Atlantic are that three independent stock assessments and management strategies would be appropriate; and that management of the eastern Caribbean stock will need to be at a regional level since the stock is shared between the different island states, while management of the southern Netherlands Antilles stock and the northeast Brazil stock could be at a national level.",GOMES C 1999 BULL MAR SCI,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,espécie não recifal

Additionally, samples were taken from the Itamaracá Estuarine System (IES), near Recife, for comparison. The data on naturally occurring stable isotopes suggest that export of POM from the IES was restricted to the reef line. This was evident by a maximum of δ13C on the inshore shelf (app. 6 to 15 km offshore). There was no measurable estuarine influence on δ13C of POM and zooplankton on the shelf. No significant differences were observed in δ13C and δ15N between the samples taken at shelf stations off Pernambuco and Ceará states, although mangrove cover in Pernambuco is more than 10 times higher than in Ceará. δ13C values of shelf zooplankton varied between -16.3 and -19.8 ‰ PDB. The difference in δ13C between zooplankton and POM was 4.2 ± 1.8 ‰. Decapod crustacean larvae showed δ13C values between –19.8 and –17.2 ‰ PDB. Copepods had δ13C values between –19.5 and –18.7 ‰ PDB. The differences in δ13C between copepods and chaetognaths found inshore and offshore were 1.1 and 1.0 ‰ PDB, respectively. After “C/N- correcting“ δ13C values, zooplankton still had significantly higher values than POM. POM δ15N varied between 1.6 and 5.6 ‰. Zooplankton was significantly higher in 15N compared with POM at estuarine and shelf stations. The difference in δ15N was 3.2 ‰. Decapod larvae showed relatively low δ15N values (similar to or even lower than zooplankton subsamples), indicating a relatively low trophic position. δ13C values of decapod larvae were generally close to the values measured for the oceanic copepod community, indicating a similarity in the utilization of pelagic primary carbon sources.",SCHWAMBORN R 1999 ARCH FISH MAR RES-a,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Same sites from the previous papaer

THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE LARGE-SCALE BEDFORMS IS PRIMARILY  DETERMINED BY THE NORTHWESTERLY FLOWING RESIDUAL OCEANIC AND TIDAL  CURRENTS RESULTING MAINLY IN COAST-PARALLEL TRANSPORT. MODELS OF SHELF  BEDFORM FORMATION PREDICT SAND RIBBONS TO OCCUR IN HIGHER ENERGY  SETTINGS RATHER THAN IN LARGE DUNES.

Although the development of spermatangia among the three species is clearly distinctive when viewed with light microscopy, there are only minor differences in spermatial subcellular structure. In the three species studied, spermatangial mother cells (SMC) differ from surrounding vegetative cells by having poorly developed chloroplasts and numerous plastoglobuli. Endoplasmic reticulum is concentrated at the cell periphery, contributing to the formation of the spermatangial vesicle (SV). The spermatangial nucleus is pushed to the upper end of the cell due to an expansion of the large SV and chloroplasts and starch grains are lacking. In the process of maturation, small cytoplasmic vesicles fuse with the cell membrane to form a mucilaginous envelope around each spermatium. Before being released, the SV releases its contents to the outside, breaking the pit connection with the SMC.

NEVERTHELESS A  NUMBER OF RECORDS HOLD UP TO CRITICAL EVALUATION. EARLY ATTEMPTS TO  RECONSTRUCT THE LGM TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION CONDITIONS FOR THE  LGM AROUND 21 C-14 KA BP HAVE SUGGESTED THAT RELATIVE TO PRESENT  LOWLAND TEMPERATURES WERE ON AVERAGE ONLY A FEW DEGREES C COOLER  WHEREAS IN THE ANDES THE TEMPERATURE DEPRESSION WAS IN THE RANGE OF 6-8  DEGREES C. THESE RECONSTRUCTIONS FURTHER SUGGESTED THAT TROPICAL  PRECIPITATION WAS MORE LIMITED IN BOTH THE LOWLANDS AND IN THE ANDES.  ALTHOUGH RECENT POLLEN EVIDENCE SUPPORTS SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER TROPICAL  LOWLAND TEMPERATURES DURING THE LGM ADDITIONAL ALKENONE EVIDENCE FROM  SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND MODEL ANALYSIS ARE CONTRADICTORY. THE DATA  FROM TROPICAL SOUTH AMERICA SUGGEST THAT THE LATE QUATERNARY CLIMATIC  CHANGES OF THE LOWLANDS AS WELL AS OF THE ANDEAN MOUNTAINS REFLECT A  RESPONSE 1 TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN THE SOURCE AREA OF THE MOISTURE  AND 2 TO GLOBAL TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS. BASED ON GLACIAL  PERIGLACIAL AND POLLEN EVIDENCE A LGM TEMPERATURE DEPRESSION OF 5-6  DEGREES C CAN BE ASSUMED FOR BOTH TROPICAL LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA AND THE  ANDES. THESE LGM VALUES FOR THE COOLING CORRESPOND WITH RECENT CORAL  RECORDS FROM BARBADOS AND THE SOUTHWESTERN PACIFIC ICE-CORE RECORDS  FROM PERU NOBLE-GAS MEASUREMENTS IN BRAZIL AND OCEAN CORE RECORDS FROM  THE WESTERN EQUATORIAL ATLANTIC. NO DIFFERENCE IN THE VALUE OF LGM  COOLING CAN BE RECOGNISED BETWEEN THE TROPICAL LOWLANDS AND THE HIGH  MOUNTAINS OF SOUTH AMERICA. FURTHERMORE IN ALL REGIONS THE LGM CLIMATES  WERE MORE ARID THAN THE PRESENT-DAY CLIMATES.

WE  STUDIED THE DIVERSITY OF CLIENTS AND THE DAILY CLEANING ACTIVITY OF THE  BARBER GOBY ELACATINUS FIGARO ON ROCKY REEFS IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL  23-24 DEGREES S. A TOTAL OF 34 FISH CLIENT SPECIES IN 16 FAMILIES WERE  RECORDED OVER 484 CLEANING EVENTS. THE MOST FREQUENT CLIENTS WERE  DAMSELFISHES POMACENTRIDAE 37.9\% OF CLEANING EVENTS AND GRUNTS  HAEMULIDAE 16.9\%. PLANKTIVORES WERE THE MOST FREQUENTLY ATTENDED  TROPHIC CATEGORY AND TWO SPECIES IN THAT CATEGORY ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT A  HALF 44\% OF THE TOTAL CLEANING EVENTS. SIZE OF CLIENTS RANGED 4.5-55  CM AND MOST INDIVIDUALS WERE MEDIUM-SIZED 12-30 CM AS THE BARBER GOBY  RANGED 2-4.5 CM CLIENTS WERE 1.5 TO 15 TIMES LARGER THAN THE CLEANER  WAS. CLEANING ACTIVITY STARTED AT DAWN AND ENDED SHORTLY BEFORE  NIGHTFALL THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF INTERACTIONS OCCURRING AT EARLY  MORNING NOCTURNAL CLIENTS AND MID-AFTERNOON DIURNAL CLIENTS. BY  MIDDAY THE FREQUENCY OF CLEANING EVENTS DECREASED AND THEIR DURATION  INCREASED. A TOTAL OF 109 +/- 3 CLEANING EVENTS AND 30 +/- 1 MIN OF  CLEANING ACTIVITY WERE ESTIMATED PER CLEANING STATION PER DAY BOTH  FIGURES LOW WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE RECORDED FOR CLEANER FISHES IN  TROPICAL AREAS OF THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND INDO-PACIFIC.,SAZIMA I 2000 ENVIRON BIOL FISHES,site_name,Laje dos Santos,NA,"24° 19' 55"" S","046° 10' 30"" W",-24.33194444,-46.175,

THE CORAL REEFS AND NEARBY COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS  CONSTITUTE A GLOBAL CONSERVATION PRIORITY AND ARE THE TARGET OF THE  ABROLHOS 2000 PROJECT INITIATED BY CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL AS PART  OF ITS GLOBAL MARINE CONSERVATION STRATEGY. ALTHOUGH PORTIONS OF THE  ABROLHOS REEFS ARE LOCATED WITHIN A MARINE PARK THEY ARE NOT AFFORDED  ADEQUATE PROTECTION DUE TO INSUFFICIENT CONSERVATION RESOURCES AND A  FAILURE TO BE PART OF A BROADER INTEGRATED COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.  THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES NONGOVERNMENTAL  ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND OTHER  STAKEHOLDERS ABROLHOS 2000 IS WORKING TO PROVIDE THESE NEEDS WHILE  ESTABLISHING LOCAL CAPACITY FOR CONSERVING COASTAL AND MARINE  ECOSYSTEMS.
