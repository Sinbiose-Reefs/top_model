THIS STUDY REPRESENTS A FIRST REPORT OF MODES OF FRAGMENTATION  AND THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE TO POPULATION GROWTH IN PALYTHOA  CARIBAEORUM CNIDARIA ZOANTHIDEA. SEVERAL POPULATIONS AT TWO COASTAL  SITES IN BRAZIL PRAIA PORTINHO ON SAO SEBASTIAO ISLAND AND PONTA  RECIFE ON THE SAO PAULO COAST WERE FOLLOWED FOR 1 YR. TWO DEPTHS IN  THE SUB-TIDAL WERE EXAMINED AT EACH SITE 0.5-1.5 M AND 2.5-4.0 M. THESE  SITES REPRESENTED DIFFERENT HABITATS CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFERENT LEVELS  OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS. FRAGMENTS WERE PRODUCED BY TWO METHODS 1  BIOTIC FRAGMENTATION TISSUE ISOLATED DUE TO BIOLOGICALLY CAUSED  LESIONS IN THIS CASE PRIMARILY DUE TO DISEASE CAUSING PARTIAL COLONY  MORTALITY IN THE COLONY AND 2 PHYSICAL FRAGMENTATION COLONIES BROKEN  INTO SEVERAL PIECES BY STORMS CURRENTS OR TIDES. BOTH MODES INVOLVED  INCIDENTAL FRAGMENTATION NOT ACTIVELY DIRECTED BY THE PARENT COLONY. OF  THE 579 COLONIES MONITORED 6.9\% EXHIBITED AT LEAST ONE MODE OF  FRAGMENTATION OVER THE PERIOD OF 1 YR PRODUCING 64 NEW RAMETS. THE  FREQUENCY OF FRAGMENTATION OR TOTAL NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS PRODUCED FROM  BOTH MODES OF FRAGMENTATION WAS INDEPENDENT OF SITE AND SEASON BUT NOT  OF DEPTH. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FRAGMENTATION WAS OBSERVED IN SHALLOWER  WATERS. THIS PATTERN COULD BE EXPLAINED BY HIGHER BIOTIC FRAGMENTATION  DUE TO DISEASE IN THESE COLONIES. THE FREQUENCY OF COLONIES FRAGMENTING  BY PHYSICAL DISTURBANCE STORMS WAS FOUND TO BE INDEPENDENT OF SITE  DEPTH AND SEASON. AT LEAST 57\% OF THE POPULATION EXHIBITED SIGNS OF  PARTIAL COLONY MORTALITY LESIONS WHICH ON THE AVERAGE AFFECTED <5\%  OF THE TOTAL COLONY AREA.

THE DISEASE SPREAD OUTWARD FROM WITHIN THE  COLONY IN A CIRCULAR PATTERN. A TRANSVERSE SECTION EXTENDING FROM NORMAL  TO DISEASED TISSUE SHOWED A PROGRESSION FROM NORMAL POLYPS TO PALE  SWOLLEN POLYPS FOLLOWED BY REMNANT SPICULE-LIKE STRUCTURES AND FINALLY  FINE BLACK MATTER AND BARE SUBSTRATUM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LESION. THE  DISEASE OCCURRED IN ONE OR MORE PORTIONS OF THE COLONY SIMULTANEOUSLY.  DISEASE FREQUENCY AND TOTAL AREA INFECTED INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH  COLONY SIZE. GENERALLY THE DISEASE AFFECTED LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 5\%  OF THE TOTAL COLONY AREA AND OCCURRED WHEN GONAD DEVELOPMENT WAS  MAXIMAL. THEREFORE 20.5\% N = 306 AND 14.6\% N = 578 OF THE  POPULATION WAS INFECTED IN TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS RESPECTIVELY. DISEASE  EXHIBITED HIGHER RATES DURING SUMMER TOURIST SEASON AND FALL AND  DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE WINTER WITH THE PRESENCE OF COOL WATER.

HIGHLY STRESSED ENVIRONMENTS. THE  EFFECTS OF DEPTH AND SEASON WERE ALSO CONSIDERED. PALYTHOA CARIBAEORUM  WAS FOUND TO REPRODUCE BY TWO NEW GENERAL PROCESSES OF FISSION. THE  FIRST PROCESS REQUIRES A THE FORMATION OF CREVICES THROUGHOUT THE  COLONY AND THE MAINTENANCE OF BASAL COENENCHYME THROUGHOUT B THE  PRODUCTION OF POLYP-CLUSTERS WHICH ARE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER BY THIN  BASAL COENENCHYME NOT READILY VISIBLE AND Q THE SUBSEQUENT SEVERANCE  OF THE BASAL COENENCHYME BETWEEN POLYP-CLUSTERS CREATING TRUE RAMETS.  THE FIRST PROCESS INCLUDED TWO VARIANTS EDGE FISSION AND POLYP-CLUSTER  RELEASE. THE SECOND FISSION PROCESS WAS CHARACTERIZED BY DIRECTIONAL  GROWTH OF TISSUE AND A SUBSEQUENT BREAKING AWAY AND DISPERSING OF THE  RAMETS. IT ALSO INCLUDED TWO VARIANTS TISSUE OUTGROWTH AND POLYP-BALL  PRODUCTION. OF THE MONITORED COLONIES 55\% NT = 579 EXHIBITED AT  LEAST ONE VARIANT OF FISSION YIELDING 1304 RAMETS OVER 1 YR. EDGE  FISSION WAS THE DOMINANT FORM OF ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN THIS SPECIES.  WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL  STRESS RESULTS IN INCREASED RAMET PRODUCTION AMONG SITES DEPTHS OR  SEASONS. FISSION OCCURRED YEAR-ROUND AND IN COLONIES OF ALL SIZES. THE  MINIMUM SIZE OF A COLONY REPRODUCING BY FISSION WAS 5 CM2. A  SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN COLONY AREA  AND NUMBER OF RAMETS PRODUCED PER COLONY. RAMET RELEASE ALSO OCCURRED  YEAR-ROUND ALTHOUGH THE FREQUENCY OF RELEASE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER  DURING THE WINTER WHEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WERE HARSHER. THIS IS  THE FIRST REPORT OF TISSUE OUTGROWTH POLYP-BALL PRODUCTION AND  POLYP-CLUSTER RELEASE FOR THE GENUS PALYTHOA AND THE FIRST REPORT OF  POLYP-BALL PRODUCTION WITHIN THE ZOANTHIDEA. THERE APPEAR TO BE NO  ANALOGUES OF POLYP-CLUSTER RELEASE WITHIN THE CNIDARIA. FISSION IN P.  CARIBAEORUM APPEARS TO BE A CONSERVATIVE TRAIT OVER A WIDE GEOGRAPHICAL  RANGE.

AFFONSO P R A M 2007 ,2007,GENETIC DIVERSITY OF THREE ORNAMENTAL REEF FISHES FAMILIES POMACANTHIDAE AND CHAETODONTIDAE FROM THE BRAZILIAN COAST.,,REEF FISHES OF THE FAMILIES POMACANTHIDAE ANGELFISH AND CHAETODONTIDAE BUTTERFLYFISH ARE POPULAR ORNAMENTAL SPECIES INTENSIVELY HARVESTED FOR THE AQUARIUM TRADE. THE IMPACTS OF SUCH ACTIVITY ON INTRA-SPECIFIC DIVERSITY AND REEF ECOSYSTEMS ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC. IN THE PRESENT WORK A FINE-SCALE GENETIC ANALYSIS USING RAPD MARKERS WAS PERFORMED IN DISTINCT SAMPLES OF THE QUEEN ANGELFISH HOLACANTHUS CILIARIS FRENCH ANGELFISH POMACANTHUS PARU AND BANDED BUTTERFLYFISH CHAETODON STRIATUS ALONG THE BRAZILIAN COAST. MOST OF THE GENETIC VARIATION IN THE THREE SPECIES WAS RELATED TO INTRA-POPULATION DIVERSITY. HOWEVER AMOVA RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT H. CILIARIS PRESENTS A SUBTLE POPULATION STRUCTURE PHIST=0.132 P=0.003 WHILE P. PARU AND C. STRIATUS PRESENT LOW GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION ESPECIALLY REMARKABLE IN THE LATTER PHIST = 0.090 P=0.001 AND PHIST=0.041 P=0.028 RESPECTIVELY. GENE FLOW NM WAS ALSO HIGHER IN C. STRIATUS THAN IN THE ANGELFISH SPECIES. THE REPORTED PATTERNS OF GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION CONTRAST WITH THE SIMILAR PELAGIC STAGE OF THE SELECTED SPECIES SUGGESTING THAT LARVAL DISPERSAL PER SE IS A POOR PREDICTOR OF POPULATION STRUCTURE IN THESE REEF FISHES. ECOLOGICAL FEATURES COUPLED WITH BIOGEOGRAPHIC HISTORY AND DISTINCT LOCAL SELECTIVE PRESSURES MIGHT PLAY A MAJOR ROLE ON THE GENETIC COMPOSITION OF EACH SPECIES. ALTHOUGH PRELIMINARY THE PRESENT RESULTS PROVIDE A BASELINE FOR MONITORING THE GENETIC VARIABILITY IN THESE REEF SPECIES. THESE DIFFERENCES IN THE GENETIC STRUCTURE AMONG CO-OCCURRING SPECIES SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF EVENTUAL EVOLUTIONARY UNITS ALONG THE BRAZILIAN PROVINCE. ,NA,NA,NA,

AGUILERA O 2020 MAR SEDMENT GEOL,2020,Miocene heterozoan carbonate systems from the western Atlantic equatorial margin in South America: The Pirabas formation,Tropical South America; Fossil assemblages; Ichnofossils; miaoCT; Micro- and macroporosity,"Outcrops of Neogene carbonates of the North Brazilian platform occur exclusively along the equatorial coast and represent some of the few existing examples of Neogene carbonate systems of the Atlantic coast of South America. The Pirabas Formation (early-middle Miocene) is the northernmost part of this platform. Although onshore mainly consists of small and scattered outcrops, it considerably extends in the subsurface keeping record of relevant geological and paleontological episodes of tropical South American history. Intending to improve the knowledge of South American carbonate and providing a solid basis for future comparisons between the Pirabas Basin and other, largely subsurface, Cenozoic basins, this research investigates the Aricuru outcrops by combining a standard petrographical and paleontological approach with advanced microCT analyses. The Aricuru area is characterized by mixed silicidastic-carbonate sand-sized deposits, which probably deposited after the early Miocene according to the palynological assemblage. The bioclastic fraction of the rock is dominated by benthic foraminifera (mostly soritids, amphisteginids, small rotaliids, and small miliolids, typical of marginal marine environments), bryozoans, calcareous algae (Halimeda), echinoderms and mollusks. The abundant siliciclastic fraction together with the taxonomic composition of the foraminiferal, echinodermal, crustacean, ichnofossil and fish assemblages indicates deposition in a tropical coastal environment featuring both protected and more exposed sectors. The carbonate system probably developed under abundant nutrient supply, which fostered heterotroph suspension feeders over hermatypic corals. The demise of this system was most likely caused by a growth in silicidastic input due to increased rainfall in the coastal area. The sedimentary evolution of the Pirabas Formation is similar to the one of the Foz do Amazonas Basin, and fits well with the general evolutionary trend of Cenozoic carbonate factories of the region, indicating the potential of the Pirabas subsurface record for understanding other Cenozoic basins, their paleoenvironmental significance, and their potential as oil, gas and water reservoirs.

However, a comprehensive compilation of all hydroid records with detailed information has not yet been published for these waters. Besides filling this knowledge gap, we provide an updated species list, along with the biogeographic status (native, introduced, or cryptogenic) of each hydroid species for the area between Ilha Comprida municipality and the state of Rio Grande do Sul. We also present the distribution patterns of hydroid morphotypes, a sampling sufficiency analysis, and spatial-temporal progress of their research. The dataset was compiled by conducting a thorough bibliographical survey, accessing data of zoological collections, and performing field surveys with experimental settlement panels. This work provides an update for new hydroid records for a large number of localities within the study area. We listed 27 families, 59 genera, 129 morphotypes, and 95 unique species. Regarding the unique species, similar to 3\% were classified as introduced, similar to 2\% as native, and similar to 95\% as cryptogenic. The 3\% of introduced species include the first record of the non-indigenous Podocoryna loyola on natural substrata and new records of this species for Sao Paulo. The 95 unique species also represent similar to 19\% and similar to 52\% of the hydroid fauna recorded in South America and Brazil, respectively.

The paleoecology was based on the distribution of benthic foraminifer functional groups associated with grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N and Œ¥13C. The results identified three biosedimentary units showing that symbiont-bearing foraminifers (Peneroplis and Archaias) decrease in abundance. However, other small taxa (Miliolinella and Cornuspira) and stress-tolerant genera (Bolivina, Elphidium and Ammonia) increase in abundance toward the core top. Grain size decreases toward the top of the core, suggesting a weakening of hydrodynamic winnowing toward recent time. The TOC and TN concentrations increase, and the C/N ratios decrease, suggesting an increase of marine productivity from nearby goblet-shaped structures called ‚Äúchapeir√µes‚Äù. Changes in the benthic foraminifer community can be linked to the sedimentological and organic matter input, which are the result of climatic and oceanographic variations at different spatial and time scales, thus illustrating reduced potential to support symbiont-bearing foraminifer communities to the end of the Holocene.",UNIV FED FLUMINENSE,"BARBOSA, CF (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED FLUMINENSE, DEPT GEOQUIM, OUTEIRO SAO JOAO BATISTA,S 5 ANDAR, BR-24020141 NITEROI, RJ, BRAZIL",PROBIO-MINISTERIO DO MEIO AMBIENTE; WORLD BANKTHE WORLD BANK INDIA; GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY (GEF); CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); [ANR2010 BLANC 608-01 ELPASO],

Even being unique in the world, reefs from its mesophotic zone (i.e., >30 m depth) have never been described. For the first time, we surveyed the bottom features of Rocas Atoll mesophotic zone by using side scan sonar, a remotely operated vehicle and TRIMIX diving. Rhodolith beds were the main habitat observed, composed mainly by crustose coralline algae, and presenting different patterns of bed structure. In deeper areas (60‚Äì80 m), most rhodoliths were coalesced in patches of ‚àº1 m2, while in the shallow areas (20‚Äì 50 m), the more typical pattern of free-living rhodoliths predominated. Depths between 50 and 65 m were marked as transitional zones in which a step-shaped carbonate reefs were discovered. In addition to describing the rhodolith beds and the formation of carbonate reefs by the coalescence of rhodoliths, we highlight the importance of oceanic areas such as the one investigated here. They are excellent models for testing and understanding the influence of rhodolith beds in supporting the marine biodiversity and in promoting demographic connectivity between shallow and mesophotic reefs",INST PESQUISAS JARDIM BOT RIO DE JANEIRO,"AMADO, GM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), INST PESQUISAS JARDIM BOT RIO DE JANEIRO, DIRETORIA PESQUISA CIENT, RUA PACHECO LEAO 915, BR-22460030 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL",BRAZILIAN COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); FAPERJFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ); FAPESPFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP); UNIVERSITY OF THE WESTERN CAPE; NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF SOUTH AFRICANATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION - SOUTH AFRICA; CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES),

During an expedition to find cnidarians in June 1998 high scleractinian and calcified hydroid diversity was encountered, a richness that in Brazil can only be compared to the Abrolhos, Bahia State): four species of calcified hydroids, twelve species of scleractinian corals, two species of sea-anemones, one species of zoanthid, and one species of octocoral. However, three of the four species of calcified hydroids observed (Millepora alcicornis, M. braziliensis, and Millepora sp.) were bleached or dead and covered by algae and/or invertebrates. Similarly, among the scleractinian corals, bleaching was observed in specimens of eleven of the twelve species recorded (Madracis decactis, Agaricia agaricites, A. fragilis, Siderastrea stellata, Porites astreoides, P. branneri, Favia gravida, F. leptophylla, Montastrea cavernosa, Meandrina braziliensis, Mussismilia hispida, and Scolymia wellsi). Bleaching was associated with elevated average monthly sea surface temperatures, which was at least 1oC higher than the previous year, and at least 1oC above the expected maximum monthly mean, according to remotely sensed data available online from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).",UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO,"AMARAL, FD (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT BIOL, AREA ZOOL, LAB AMBIENTAES RECIFAIS, AV DOM MANUEL MEDEIROS S-N, BR-52171030 RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL",NA,

The southernmost Brazilian rocky reefs are the southern limit of distribution for 96\% of the tropical ichthyofauna of the western Atlantic. The Arvoredo Marine Biological Reserve is the only nearshore no-take marine-protected area (MPA) located in this transition zone. The main aim was to investigate how the populations of rocky reef fish species vary in density and biomass in space and over time, inside and outside the Arvoredo MPA. This study presents results based on a 9 year (2008-2017) underwater visual census monitoring study to evaluate the density and biomass of key fish species. Variations in density and biomass were detected for most species. Factors and mechanisms that may have influenced spatial variation are habitat structural complexity and protection from fisheries. Temporal variations, otherwise, may have been influenced by species proximity to their distributional limit, in synergy with density-dependent mechanisms and stochastic winter temperature oscillations. The MPAs harbour higher density and biomass for most species.

ALL  EVIDENCE FOR HOLOCENE SEALEVELS POINT TO THE ELEVATIONS HIGHER THAN THE  PRESENT IN THE AGE INTERVAL BETWEEN 5.06 KA AND 0.55 KA. THE ALTITUDE  AND AGES OF THE RECONSTRUCTIONS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH HINDCAST  MODEL CURVES AND THE EMPIRICAL SEALEVEL ENVELOPE FOR THE MAINLAND  EASTERN AND NORTHEASTERN BRAZILIAN COAST. HOWEVER THE POSITION OF PALEO  VERMETID-REEF INDICATES THAT SEALEVEL WAS LOWER THAN EUSTATIC ELEVATION  SUGGESTING AN EFFECT OF ISLAND SUBSIDENCE. IN CONTRAST TO THE BRAZILIAN  MAINLAND COASTAL ZONE WHERE CONSPICUOUS EVIDENCES OF PLEISTOCENE  HIGHSTANDS WERE RECORDED NO EVIDENCE OF SEALEVELS PREDATING THE  HOLOCENE HAS EVER BEEN OBSERVED ON THE ISLAND. THIS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED  TO INTENSE COASTAL EROSION AND LOG-TERM ISLAND SUBSIDENCE.  A VOLCANIC EDIFICE RISING MORE THAN 5500 M ABOVE THE OCEAN FLOOR WAS  BUILT BY MAGMATIC ACTIVITY THAT EXTENDED OVER THE LATE PLIOCENE AND  EARLY PLEISTOCENE. AFTER THE CESSATION OF VOLCANIC BUILD UP THE ISLAND  STARTED TO SHRINK DUE TO SUBAERIAL AND MARINE EROSION. DURING  PLEISTOCENE SEALEVEL LOWSTANDS ALLUVIAL FANS WERE FORMED BEYOND THE  PRESENT LIMITS OF EMERGED AREAS. THEY WERE ENCLOSED WITHIN AND PRESERVED  FROM EROSION BY THE MIDDLE TO LATE PLEISTOCENE LAVA FLOWS AND  PYROCLASTIC DEPOSITS. DURING LATE PLEISTOCENE SEALEVEL HIGHSTAND  INTENSE COASTAL EROSION REMOVED THE DISTAL PARTS OF THE ALLUVIAL FANS.  IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT AT THAT TIME THE ENTIRE COAST OF THE ISLAND  EXPERIENCED INTENSE EROSION AND SUBSIDENCE AS DEDUCED FROM THE ABSENCE  OF PLEISTOCENE COASTAL DEPOSITS WHICH ARE WIDESPREAD ALONG MAINLAND  BRAZILIAN COAST.  THE EAST COAST OF THE ISLAND WAS DOMINATED BY HIGH SEA CLIFFS SCULPTED  INTO VOLCANIC ROCKS. A VOLCANIC CONE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FORMED WHEN THE  SEALEVEL WAS LOWER THAN PRESENT DURING THE LATE PLEISTOCENE TO EARLY  HOLOCENE. DURING THE MID TO LATE HOLOCENE SEALEVEL HIGHSTAND THE  VOLCANIC CONE WAS PARTIALLY ERODED AND A BAY FORMED WHERE  VERMETID-REEFS GROW AND SAND BEACH DEPOSITS PROGRADED UNTIL THE BAY WAS  INFILLED. DURING THE SEALEVEL MAXIMUM WAVE-CUT TERRACES WERE FORMED AND  SEA CLIFFS WERE ACTIVE. DURING THE LOWERING OF THE SEALEVEL CLIFFS  BECAME INACTIVE AND VERMETID-REEFS WERE ERODED.

The analysis strongly corroborates the validity of all species of the genus and shows that Scartella cristata, a species with a disjunct distribution, is a lineage complex comprising five clades: two in Caribbean waters, another in the East Atlantic/Mediterranean and two in Brazil. Brazilian clades occur in sympatry from Rio de Janeiro to Rio Grande do Sul states (southern Brazil). One Glade (BRA 1) is unique to Brazil, while the other (BRA 2) is closely related to the eastern Atlantic lineage.

Analysis of the edges of otolith sections suggests that one translucent and one opaque zone are formed once a year. Observed size and age class ranges for H. plumierii were 218‚Äì378 mm total length (TL) and 2‚Äì28 years, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth models estimated were significantly different between sexes. The growth models for females, males and all fish were Lt = 298.0[1 ‚Äì e‚Äì 0.59(t‚Äì0.08)], Lt = 331.8[1 ‚Äì e‚Äì 0.35(t+1.08)] and Lt = 312.2[1 ‚Äì e‚Äì 0.48(t+0.32)], respectively. Growth is fast during the first 4 years of life, when the average fish size is already in excess of 80% of the asymptotic size. The maximum age observed in this study is greater than those previously reported for H. plumierii.

This work compared the effects of ecological drivers on components of fish diversity across reefs spanning over 2.000 km of the tropical Brazilian coastline. A quarter of communities' diversity is accountable to common and dominant species, while remaining species are rare. Low-latitude sites were more diverse in rare species. Communities along the coast share common and dominant species, which display high densities across all reefs, but differ in rare species that show abundance peaks in particular reef morphotypes. The disproportionate distribution of rare species reveals a higher vulnerability of these communities to impacts and stochastic density fluctuations. Uneven conservation efforts directed to these morphotypes pose a threat to the maintenance of a paramount component of the reef fish diversity represented by rare species",NA,NA,NA,

In the Arraial do Cabo Bay coast upper Holocene aragonitic vermetids are represented by monospecific clusters of overgrowing Petaloconchus varians occurring in supratidal/intertidal carbonate and mixed siliciclastic-carbonate deposits. Based on stable isotope composition (delta C-13, delta O-18) of fossil vermetid shells, radiocarbon ages and altimetric survey, the upper Holocene upwelling system of the Cabo Frio area (southeastern Brazil, Rio de Janeiro) is assessed. In the studied region, at 3700 cal. years BP the maximum relative sea level (RSL) was + 4.0 m with a SST of 20.7 degrees C. Subsequently, vermetid-based SST decreased from similar to 22.8 to similar to 17 degrees C (at similar to 3300 cal. years BP), with the coldest temperatures recording a strong upwelling event at around 2000 cal. years BP when the RSL was at + 2 m. The intensification in upwelling water masses is identified by the C-13 enrichment, along with higher delta O-18, in the vermetid shells. The decreasing SST trend assessed from similar to 3300 to similar to 2000 cal. years BP can be related to more frequent South Atlantic Coastal Water intrusions on the surface layer in the mid-shelf, increasing the nutrient concentration in the upper layer. From similar to 1900 to similar to 1300 cal. years BP, a higher SST up to similar to 21 degrees C occurred during the continuous sea-level fall",UNIV FED RIO GRANDE,"TAMEGA, FTD (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED RIO GRANDE, INST OCEANOG, PROGRAMA POSGRAD OCEANOL, AV ITALIA KM 8, BR-96203900 RIO GRANDE, RS, BRAZIL","COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR - CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES) [88882.314604/2019-01, 88887.320380/2019-00]; CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO - CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [477749/2014]; PPGL; UFRJ; UNIVERSITY OF FERRARA; PROJECT MIUR-DIPARTIMENTI DI ECCELLENZA 2018-2022 [PRIN 2017RX9XXXY]",

This study aims to test seahorse camouflage effectiveness in relation to a territorial species. Seahorses were translocated into the territory of the damselfish Stegastes fuscus (Cuvier) and its aggressive behaviour was recorded. Stegastes fuscus was chosen as being a good model of an aggressive fish, probably able to detect any transgressor. Seahorse size, sex, colour and mobility were recorded, as was the colour of the substrate used as holdfast. Eighty-four percent of the translocated seahorses were not attacked. There was no relation between number of attacks and size, sex or colour of seahorse and its holdfast. Seahorses that remained still during the experiment (84%) were not attacked, but those that moved were attacked (16%). It was observed in this study that neither seahorse color nor size were relevant characters in camouflage fitness, but probably all these together, including behavior, improved survival fitness",NA,NA,NA,

THE REEF HAD MORE HETEROGENEOUS SEDIMENTS AND A HIGHER ORGANIC MATTER  CONTENT AND ITS FAUNA WAS DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE BEACH WITH A  HIGHER DENSITY SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY. THE REEF FAUNA INCLUDED  TAXA TYPICAL OF BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND UNCONSOLIDATED SUBSTRATES.

THEY SPAWN OFFSHORE NEAR CORAL  REEFS OR SMALL ISLANDS. THE EGGS EMBRYOS AND LARVAE ARE PELAGIC AND  RELATIVELY LARGER THAN THOSE OF MOST MARINE SPECIES. LARVAE GREATER THAN  OR EQUAL TO 10 MM LONG AND 2-3 WEEKS OLD MOVE INSHORE VIA A COMBINATION  OF PASSIVE ADVECTION AND ACTIVE MIGRATION. PASSING SHORE WATERS AND SURF  ZONES THEY SETTLE IN SHALLOW-WATER DEPOSITIONAL HABITATS SUCH AS  MANGROVE SWAMPS AND CORAL LAGOONS WHERE THEY METAMORPHOSE AND SPEND A  FEW MONTHS AS JUVENILES. SOME JUVENILES MAY ENTER FRESHWATER LAKES WHERE  THEY GROW INTO SUB-ADULTS BUT DO NOT MATURE.

BAHR A 2020 BIOGEOSCIENCES,2020,Monsoonal forcing of cold-water coral growth off southeastern Brazil during the past 160 kyr,DEEP-SEA CORALS; FOOD-SUPPLY MECHANISMS; BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; WESTERN BOUNDARY; SOLENOSMILIA-VARIABILIS; MEDITERRANEAN OUTFLOW; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; UPWELLING SYSTEM; LOPHELIA-PERTUSA,"Cold-water corals (CWCs) constitute important deep-water ecosystems that are under increasing environmental pressure due to ocean acidification and global warming. The sensitivity of these deep-water ecosystems to environmental change is demonstrated by abundant paleorecords drilled through CWC mounds that reveal characteristic alterations between rapid formation and dormant or erosive phases. Previous studies have identified several central parameters for driving or inhibiting CWC growth such as food supply, oxygenation, and the carbon saturation state of bottom water, yet there are still large uncertainties about the relative importance of the different environmental parameters. To advance this debate we have performed a multiproxy study on a sediment core retrieved from the 25 m high Bowie Mound, located at 866 m water depth on the continental slope off southeastern Brazil, a structure built up mainly by the CWC Solenosmilia variabilis. Our results indicate a multifactorial control on CWC growth at Bowie Mound during the past similar to 160 kyr, which reveals distinct formation pulses during northern high-latitude glacial cold events (Heinrich stadials, HSs) largely associated with anomalously strong monsoonal rainfall over the continent. The ensuing enhanced runoff elevated the terrigenous nutrient and organic-matter supply to the continental margin and likely boosted marine productivity. The dispersal of food particles towards the CWC colonies during HSs was facilitated by the highly dynamic hydraulic conditions along the continental slope that prevailed throughout glacial periods. These conditions caused the emplacement of a pronounced nepheloid layer above Bowie Mound, thereby aiding the concentration and along-slope dispersal of organic matter. Our study thus emphasizes the impact of continental climate variability on a highly vulnerable deep-marine ecosystem.",HEIDELBERG UNIV,"BAHR, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), HEIDELBERG UNIV, INST EARTH SCI, NEUENHEIMER FELD 234, D-69120 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTGERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [HO5927/1-1, EXC-2077 -390741603]",

IF A COMMON PATTERN EXISTS CAN IT BE BETTER DISCERNED IN THE  NON-GLACIATED TECTONICALLY STABLE REGIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE?  AND IS SEA LEVEL DATA MORE RELIABLE FROM ONE TYPE OF MARINE SAMPLE THAN  ANOTHER? TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION OF THESE QUESTIONS WE PRESENT A  REVIEW OF REGRESSING TIME-ELEVATION PLOTS FROM THE LOW TO MID LATITUDES  OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE BASED UPON THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN MODERN  AND PAST LEVELS OF VARIOUS FIXED BIOLOGICAL INDICATORS MAINLY  CALCAREOUS TUBEWORMS AND CORALS STRANDED UP TO SIMILAR TO 2 M ABOVE  PRESENT RELATIVE SEA LEVELS. THE SAMPLE SETS COME FROM OUR WORK IN  SOUTHEAST AUSTRALIA AND COMPARABLE WORK FROM NORTH-EAST AUSTRALIA THE  PACIFIC ISLANDS AND BRAZIL. WE SHOW THAT USING EVIDENCE OBTAINED FROM  FIXED INTERTIDAL TUBEWORM SPECIES THERE IS NO STATISTICAL EXCLUSIVITY  BETWEEN THE SMOOTH AND OSCILLATING POLYNOMIALS BUT CORALS ARE MORE  PROBLEMATIC. IN SITU TUBEWORM SPECIES WITH THEIR REDUCED ERROR BARS IN  COMPARISON TO CORALS FULFIL THE CONDITION OF PROVIDING MORE ROBUST  RESULTS FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. REGRESSION CURVES BASED ON THESE  SPECIES POINT TO CROSS-REGIONAL SIMILARITIES IN THE PATTERN OF SEA-LEVEL  MOVEMENT OF THE LAST 6000 YEARS ACROSS THE LOWER LATITUDES OF THE  SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. THESE STATISTICAL EXERCISES WHILE NOT ABLE TO  YIELD DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS CAN HIGHLIGHT STATISTICALLY EQUALLY LIKELY  ALTERNATIVE PATTERNS OF SEA-LEVEL MOVEMENT WHICH CAN THEN BE TESTED BY  FIELD EVIDENCE. THEY CAN ALSO GIVE USEFUL INDICATIONS OF THE QUALITY OF  SEA-LEVEL DATA OBTAINED FROM DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL SOURCES AS IN THE  DIFFICULTIES IN THE USE OF CORALS COMPARED TO COMMON INTERTIDAL TUBEWORM  SPECIES.

A total of 15 individuals of each species of macroalgae adhered to natural substrate and 15 individuals of Padina gymnospora detached from the substrate were collected. The structural complexity of algal habitats was measured and the associated malacofauna screened and identified. All three macroalgae differed significantly in the complexity of their habitat, with Sargassum polyceratium being the most complex. A total of 823 specimens of mollusks belonging to 22 species and 11 families were recorded, of which Columbellidae was the most represented with six species. The functional trait ‚Äúsize‚Äù revealed that micromollusks smaller than 10 millimeters were predominant in the community; however, individuals of larger sizes (up to 24.54 millimeters) belonging to young stages of other species were also present. Eight functional trophic groups were identified, of which ‚Äúcarnivorous‚Äù stood out with seven species. Six functional groups of microhabitats were identified, with intra‚Äêspecific variation in habitats, while habitat expansion was documented for species not yet recorded in association with macroalgae. The structure of the molluskan community differed among the three algae species with the greatest richness, abundance, and diversity of mollusks and functional traits occurring with S. polyceratium . Community structure differed between algae adhered to natural substrate and detached algae, with the latter having lower mollusk richness and diversity, but with greater abundance of some species that remained on algal fronds after release from the reef environment. This study reinforces the importance of algal habitat for marine invertebrate fauna, especially for micromollusks that spend their entire life cycle, or part of it, in association with macroalgae.",UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO,"BARBOSA, DF (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, PROGRAMA POSGRAD ETNOBIOL \& CONSERVACAO NAT, DEPT BIOL, RUA DOM MANOEL DE MEDEIROS S-N, BR-52171900 RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL",NA,

Although this practice is prohibited in Marine Protected Areas (MPA), practices such as fishing with compressor devices have been reported at the Marine Extractive Reserve of Corumbau (MERC), Brazil. In this case study we use data on MERC fisher knowledge and attitudes concerning compressor fishing gathered through semi-structured interviews to discuss MPA strengths and weaknesses in preventing IUU fishing. Interviewees strongly oppose IUU fishing, complaining it is one of the main reasons for declines in local fishing yield. Respondents indicate that non-local compressor vessels were frequently observed prior to the establishment of MERC, and while such sightings are now less frequent, these vessels continue to appear. At the same time, respondents also indicate that marine environmental enforcement actions are rare. We discuss the roles, potentials, and limitations of MPAs in preventing illegal fishing and protecting fishers from competition with industrial fishing.

Data on the spatial structure of these ecosystems are essential for good quality conservation projects in such areas. This study aimed to quantitatively analyze the spatial distribution of benthic macroorganisms from the reef environment of Porto de Galinhas Beach, with special focus on its corals and calcified hydroids. Reef flats of the area were surveyed by scuba diving, using 10m line transects. A high cover of macroalgae was verified, averaging 53% of the observations. Zoanthids were the second most representative group (11%).

Most southwestern Atlantic reefs are characterized by high sedimentation. However, there are no temporal series of sediment deposition rates. We evaluated sediment deposition, the sediment carbonate composition and coral and zoanthid covers on six reefs in Brazil over four-years. Sediment deposition rates varied from near zero to 233 mg cm-2 day-1, with peaks between August and December, and yearly averages ranging from nine to 104 mg cm-2 day-1. Deposition rates presented site-specific correlations with wind, indicating that resuspension must be a major factor. The presence of carbonates varied from 38% to 90%, with two sites showing seasonal differences. Benthic communities were fairly similar among sites, but the analyses suggested particular frequencies at each site. There was no significant correlation between sediment and benthic communities. However, Palythoa caribaeorum usually occur in high sediment deposition areas. Our results did not corroborate previous data that suggested that a 10 mg cm-2 day-1 would be a ""critical limit for coral survival"".

Lytechinus variegatus is a common sea urchin known for its covering behavior. We hypothesized that L. variegatus would select more marine debris (i.e. litter) than natural material as cover and we also expected that the selected natural and artificial material would be different in weight, sizes and transparency. We haphazardly collected marine debris and natural material on 20 individuals of L. variegatus and on the bottom, around each individual. All sampled material was weighed, measured and classified regarding opacity, nature (natural or artificial). Our results showed that i) sea urchins picked more litter than natural objects, ii) proportional weight of litter carried by urchins was significantly larger than expected by chance, iii) when considering all objects (on urchins and on the bottom) litter was heavier, wider and less opaque than natural material and iv) litter carried by the urchins were wider and less opaque than natural material.

Most frequent organisms massive and branched coralline algae Favia gravida and Agaricia agaricites also had many significant positive coexistence events. These results might be related to the abundances of these organisms. The most frequent coral Siderastrea stellata however exhibited only a few significant coexistence events 9% of 32 tests.

A correlation test of number of ingested plastic fibres against trophic diversity was made to corroborate the hypothesis that plastic ingestion modifies the feeding patterns. Our results demonstrated that contaminated individuals had lower body condition. Also, we confirmed that debris ingestion can influence feeding patterns.

HEREIN SHELF  MORPHOLOGY AND SEDIMENTOLOGY ARE INVESTIGATED IN ORDER TO DISCUSS HOW  THESE CHARACTERISTICS CAN BE REPRESENTATIVE OF DISTINCT SEDIMENTARY  REGIMES. THE STUDY AREA IS THE EASTERN BRAZILIAN SHELF WHERE COASTAL  TRANSGRESSION AND REGRESSION COEXIST WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT CORAL REEF  SYSTEM OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC. A COMPILATION OF EXISTING PUBLISHED AND  UNPUBLISHED DATA WAS CARRIED OUT IN ORDER TO PRODUCE MORPHOLOGICAL AND  FACIOLOGICAL MAPS AND COMPARE THE MAPPED FEATURES WITH HIGH-RESOLUTION  SEISMIC AND SONOGRAPHIC DATA. THE RESULTS SHOW THREE MAJOR REGIONS OR  MORPHOLOGICAL COMPARTMENTS ABROLHOS SHELF DOCE RIVER SHELF AND THE  PALEOVALLEYS SHELF. IN TERMS OF SHELF SEDIMENTARY DOMAIN RHODOLITH BEDS  PREDOMINATE OVER THE OUTER SHELF ALONG THE ENTIRE AREA CORALLINE REEFS  ARE PRESENT ALONG THE NORTHERN ABROLHOS INNER SHELF AND A SIGNIFICANT  TERRIGENOUS MUD DEPOSIT IS OBSERVED ASSOCIATED TO THE DOCE RIVER  ADJACENT INNER SHELF BEDS. THE REST OF THE SHELF IS COMPOSED BY  BIOCLASTIC OR TERRIGENOUS MUD SAND AND GRAVEL. TERRIGENOUS SEDIMENTATION  IS ALWAYS RESTRICTED TO THE SHOREFACE OR INNER SHELF SHALLOWER AREAS AND  CARBONATE SANDS AND GRAVELS ARE PREDOMINANT ELSEWHERE. THE ABROLHOS  SHELF SHOWS TWO DISTINCT SECTORS THE NORTHERN AREA IS A TYPICAL MIXED  SEDIMENT ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS A SUPPLY REGIME ALONG THE COAST/SHOREFACE  MAINLY DUE TO LONGSHORE TRANSPORT AND A CARBONATE REGIME ALONG THE INNER  AND OUTER SHELF. THE SOUTHERN SHELF MORPHOLOGY AND SEDIMENTATION ARE  CONTROLLED BY THE ANTECEDENT TOPOGRAPHY AND IS TYPICALLY A ACCOMMODATION  REGIME SHELF WITH ASSOCIATED RHODOLITH BEDS. THE DOCE RIVER SHELF IS A  SUPPLY REGIME ENVIRONMENT WITH THE FORMATION OF A 5-8 M THICK REGRESSIVE  DEPOSIT WITH DOWNLAPPING DINOFORMS. SOUTHWARD FROM THE DOCE RIVER SHELF  A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN SEDIMENTARY REGIME IS OBSERVED AS THE MORPHOLOGY  BECOMES VERY IRREGULAR WITH ASSOCIATED HARDBOTTOMS AND UNFILLED  PALEOVALLEYS. THIS SECTOR OF THE SHELF PALEOVALLEY SHELF IS  CHARACTERIZED BY AN ACCOMMODATION REGIME. THE INTERPRETATION SHOWS THAT  THE ENTIRE STUDY AREA CAN BE DEFINED AS A MIXED SEDIMENTATION SHELF  SHOWING SUPPLY AND ACCOMMODATION REGIMES. SHELF MORPHOLOGY WORKED AS AN  INDICATOR OF THESE CHANGES. CARBONATE/TERRIGENOUS DEPOSITION DURING A  HIGHSTAND/REGRESSIVE PHASE COEVAL ALONG THE EASTERN BRAZILIAN SHELF  EITHER LATERALLY AND ACROSS SHELF. THIS LATERAL/ALONG COAST VARIATION IN  SEDIMENT SUPPLY AND CARBONATE PRODUCTION LEADS TO DISTINCT LATERAL  FACIES AND GEOMETRY. THESE SPATIAL CHANGES IN MORPHOLOGY AND FADES WITH  COEXISTENCE OF CARBONATE AND SILICICLASTIC SEDIMENTATION ARE VERY  IMPORTANT FOR THE CORRELATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL  RECORD ESPECIALLY STRATIGRAPHIC SURFACES AND SEQUENCE UNITS.

AT THE B1 MARGIN UNIT 2 CONSISTS OF EARLY-LITHIFIED  PACKSTONE TO RUDSTONE WITH ATTACHED CORALS. IN B2 THE HOLOCENE UNIT  COMPRISES A BOUNDSTONE OF ENCRUSTING INVERTEBRATES AND CALCAREOUS ALGAE  SIMILAR TO THE LIVING ONES ATTACHED TO THE WALL TODAY. HIGH PRODUCTIVITY  IN THE SINKHOLES PROBABLY PROMOTED THE GROWTH OF ENCRUSTING SUSPENSION  FEEDERS BUT ALSO LED TO INTENSE MULTISTORY BIOPERFORATION OF CARBONATES  ON THE WALL.

We searched global, national and local threatened species lists for Brazilian reef fish species and compared the differences between them with respect to categories and criteria applied. Of 559 Brazilian reef fish species, 125 have been evaluated against threat criteria at different scales; a total of 43 are listed as threatened with extinction. Of 43 threatened species, 32 are mentioned in the global IUCN Red List, 11 are referred to in the national inventory, and state lists also cite 11. Six endemic species are threatened; of these, 3 are listed by the IUCN, 5 at the national level and 2 are threatened in Esp√≠rito Santo state. This highlights a mismatch between species lists: 84.8% of the species listed as globally threatened do not appear in the national list, whereas 54.5% of the species mentioned on the Brazilian list are not in the IUCN Red List. Moreover, we found disagreements in the set of categories and criteria applied in the different red listing processes. The same categories and quantitative criteria must be applied in all regional red lists, so that conservation actions are more effective and lists are trustworthy. This is imperative to attract financial support for threatened species management and recovery. Management plans must be developed for those species already listed as threatened in Brazil. In addition, a review of the national list and the inclusion of threatened Brazilian endemic fishes in the IUCN Red List are needed.",UNIV FED SANTA CATARINA,"BENDER, MG (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED SANTA CATARINA, DEPT ECOL \& ZOOL, PROGRAMA POSGRAD ECOL, EDIFICIO FRITZ MULLER, BR-88010970 FLORIANOPOLIS, SC, BRAZIL",CORAL VIVO RESEARCH NETWORK,

The distributions of 1629 fish species were compiled for 31 locations across the A tlantic O cean (39¬∞66‚Ä≤ N , 27¬∞50‚Ä≤ S ). These locations provide a richness gradient ranging from 54 species in S t P aul's R ocks to 474 in C uba. We used cluster analyses to assess how historical and biogeographic factors have shaped the taxonomic and functional structure (i.e. the distribution of species within families, diet and body size groups) of assemblages. We then employed a constrained analysis of principal coordinates (CAP ) to test the relative influence of the distance from the biodiversity centre in the A tlantic, sea surface temperature, isolation, coral species richness and area, and coastal length on the observed patterns of assemblage structure. The taxonomic and functional structure of reef fish assemblages across the A tlantic exhibits a biogeographic fingerprint, with a marked discrimination between species‚Äêrich biogenic reefs (concentrated primarily in the C aribbean and composed of small species feeding on invertebrates) and poorer peripheral regions dominated by larger species with more diverse diets. The first CAP axis explains 87% of body size distribution in assemblages, showing that the effects of sea surface temperature and coral richness and those of isolation are antagonistic and can be embedded into a single dimension. Environmental factors, such as temperature and habitat complexity, explain the disproportionate number of small species in the C aribbean, whereas in the remaining regions the predominance of large‚Äêbodied fish increases with isolation due to high dispersal ability.",UNIV FED SANTA CATARINA,"BENDER, MG (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED SANTA CATARINA, DEPT ECOL \& ZOOL, PROGRAMA POSGRAD ECOL, EDIFICIO FRITZ MULLER, BR-88010970 FLORIANOPOLIS, SC, BRAZIL",CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ),

BENELI TM 2020 MAR ENVIRON RES,2020,Ghost fishing impacts on hydrocorals and associated reef fish assemblages,Fire-coral; Fishing line; Coral mortality; Fish behavior; Habitat degradation; Coral-fish interaction,"Ghost fishing is a threat to many marine environments, as lost or discarded fishing gear (e.g., fishing lines, nets) continues to fish by entangling, damaging or killing various organisms. Among the benthic organisms that live on tropical reefs, the group probably most affected, due to their shape, are the branching corals. These corals provide refuge, foraging and breeding sites, especially for fishes and therefore impacts on coral structure could compromise the ecology of associated species. We tested if fishing lines entangled on the branching coral Millepora alcicornis would result in an increase in colony mortality, decrease in abundance and richness of fishes and changes in the behavior of associated reef fish. In the field, we estimated the volume of M. alcicornis colonies and its mortality percentages, and videos were recorded to evaluate abundance and richness of fish assemblages and fish behavior. Our results showed that coral mortality increased with increasing amounts of entangled fishing lines. Fish assemblages were similar in M. alcicornis colonies with or without entangled fishing lines. Nevertheless, we observed a significant decrease in the frequency of feeding attempts in two herbivore fish species (Acanthurus bahianus and Ophioblennius trinitatis) that play an important role in coral-reef dynamics, controlling algae abundances. Therefore, ghost fishing has negative impacts on shallow reef ecosystems, directly affecting branching corals and important coral-fish interactions. Management of tropical shallow reef environments should consider regulation and monitoring of coastal fisheries to ensure reef integrity",NA,NA,NA,

The coral holobiont consists of the coral animal and a variety of associated microorganisms that include symbiotic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses. The interactions among these components are crucial for coral health and, consequently, to the coral reef resilience to disturbance. Environmental stressors such as elevated temperature, high irradiance and ultraviolet (UV) radiation can lead to the breakdown of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis in a phenomenon known as ‚Äúcoral bleaching‚Äù. The present study provides evidence for virus-like particles (VLPs) induced in UV-irradiated Symbiodinium spp. cultures (clades A and C) that were isolated from the coral Mussismilia braziliensis, suggesting a latent viral infection in these strains. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images of the UV stressed cultures revealed the presence of giant (ca. 450 nm) and small (ca. 40 nm) VLPs.

Its variability in movements across habitat types suggests the possibility of a complex genetic population structure. Here, we use mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to investigate the genetic connectivity of the Caribbean reef shark across contemporary and evolutionary time‚Äêscales and relate our findings to the ecology of this understudied species. Samples were obtained from 216 individuals from six western Atlantic and Caribbean locations. Individuals were genotyped at seven nuclear microsatellite DNA loci and sequenced at two mitochondrial (control region [CR ]; NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 [ND 4]) and one nuclear locus (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH ]). Analyses to resolve the population genetic structure and evolutionary history of this species were adopted. Findings of genetic differentiation are concordant with previous movement studies showing residency and/or site‚Äêfidelity to specific locations by individuals. However, similar to other reef shark studies, we found that the level of genetic connectivity among populations was context dependent‚Äîi.e., sharks occupying isolated habitats showed greater genetic differentiation compared with those sharks occupying semi‚Äêisolated or continuous reef habitats. Furthermore, low genetic diversity and a shallow mitochondrial population history were found, suggesting historical demographic fluctuations, including population collapse and more recent expansions.",NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIV,"BERNARD, AM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIV, HALMOS COLL NAT SCI \& OCEANOG, SAVE OUR SEAS SHARK RES CTR, DANIA, FL 33004 USA",SAVE OUR SEAS FOUNDATION; GUY HARVEY OCEAN FOUNDATION; SHARK FOUNDATION/HAI STIFTUNG; CAPE ELEUTHERA FOUNDATION; OVERSEAS TERRITORIES ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMME; PRITZKER FOUNDATION; WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY MARINE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM; SAO PAULO RESEARCH FOUNDATIONFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP); FAPESPFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP) [1998/15080-8]; PADI FOUNDATION; PROJECT AWARE,

These fishes dwell in a wide range of habitats, but most studies on parrotfish feeding behavior and ecology have been made on coral reef sites. We report on parrotfishes with damaged dentition at Fernando de Noronha, a volcanic archipelago off the coast of northeast Brazil, in the tropical southwest Atlantic Ocean. We recorded tooth damage only in adult individuals (>40 cm total length [TL]) of 3 common species (Sparisoma amplum, S. axillare and S. frondosum) in the study area. The frequency of tooth damage varied among the species: 0.85% in S. amplum, 2.34% in S. axillare and 0.76% in S. frondosum. Two types of tooth damage were recorded: broken teeth and the whole dental plate protruding from the mouth. Individuals with damaged dentition were recorded at 6 out of 10 study sites. The abundance of parrotfishes with tooth damage and their presence at several sites within the archipelago indicate that this is a common and predictable event in the area. The reefs of Fernando de Noronha Archipelago comprise mostly basaltic rocks, which are much harder than the calcium carbonate matrix that generally composes coral reefs where most studies on parrotfish behavior and ecology have been conducted. This may explain the absence of reports of parrotfishes with damaged teeth in the scientific literature to date.",JAMES COOK UNIV,"BONALDO, RM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), JAMES COOK UNIV, SCH MARINE \& TROP BIOL, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA",NA,

THROUGH AN INTEGRATED ANALYSIS OF THE GEOMORPHOLOGY AND  SEDIMENTARY DISTRIBUTION TWO MORPHO-SEDIMENTARY DOMAINS WERE  IDENTIFIED A SEDIMENT-FED SHELF ADJACENT TO THE DOCE RIVER ASSOCIATED  WITH A MAJOR MUD DEPOCENTER AND A DELTA FRONT MORPHOLOGY CHARACTERIZED  BY GENTLE SLOPES AND LOW TERRAIN RUGGEDNESS AND A SEDIMENT-STARVED  SHELF DOMINATED BY CARBONATE SEDIMENTATION SHOWING AN IRREGULAR  MORPHOLOGY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SLOPES AND TERRAIN RUGGEDNESS. THESE  CONTRASTING MORPHO-SEDIMENTARY DOMAINS ARE A RESULT OF SEDIMENTARY  RESPONSES TO SEA LEVEL FLUCTUATION DURING LATE QUATERNARY SPECIALLY  DURING THE DEGLACIATION PROCESSES AFTER THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM. THE  MORPHOLOGICAL AND SEDIMENTARY CONTRASTS ALONG THE AREA DEFINE THE  PHYSICAL HABITAT DISTRIBUTION. THE SEDIMENT SUPPLY REGIME AREA IS  ASSOCIATED WITH A TERRIGENOUS FINE/MUDDY SEDIMENTATION BED WHICH  CONTROL THE LOCAL MORPHOLOGY AND FAVORS COASTAL AND DELTA FRONT  PROGRADATION. THIS PHYSICAL HABITAT IS A WELL-KNOWN SHRIMP-FISHING  GROUND WHERE INTENSE TRAWLING TAKES PLACE AS WELL AS GILLNET FISHERIES  TARGETING WEAKFISH AND CROAKERS. THE ACCOMMODATION REGIME OR LOW  SEDIMENT INFLUX AREA IS CHARACTERIZED BY CARBONATE SEDIMENTATION  ASSOCIATED WITH HARDGROUNDS AND RHODOLITH BEDS. IN CONTRAST THIS  PHYSICAL HABITAT WITH SCARCE SEDIMENT SUPPLY FACILITATES EXTENSIVE  BENTHIC COLONIZATION BY CRUSTOSE CORALLINE ALGAE CCA WHICH IS  PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED TO LINE FISHERIES LONGLINES AND SPEARFISHING.  RHODOLITHS SHOW A HIGH DIVERSITY OF CCA AND THE OCCURRENCE OF AN ENDEMIC  KELP SPECIES.

Although the development of spermatangia among the three species is clearly distinctive when viewed with light microscopy, there are only minor differences in spermatial subcellular structure. In the three species studied, spermatangial mother cells (SMC) differ from surrounding vegetative cells by having poorly developed chloroplasts and numerous plastoglobuli. Endoplasmic reticulum is concentrated at the cell periphery, contributing to the formation of the spermatangial vesicle (SV). The spermatangial nucleus is pushed to the upper end of the cell due to an expansion of the large SV and chloroplasts and starch grains are lacking. In the process of maturation, small cytoplasmic vesicles fuse with the cell membrane to form a mucilaginous envelope around each spermatium. Before being released, the SV releases its contents to the outside, breaking the pit connection with the SMC. Spermatangia have a cell wall with two layers, but spermatia are naked when released.",UNIV FED SANTA CATARINA,"BOUZON, ZL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED SANTA CATARINA, CTR CIENCIAS BIOL, C POSTAL 476, BR-88040900 FLORIANOPOLIS, SC, BRAZIL",NA,

Res.,2020,"Micro- and mesozooplankton at the edges of coastal tropical reefs (Tamandare, Brazil",Coastal tropical reefs; Zooplankton; Copepods; Carbon biomass; New methods,"Tropical reef ecosystems are generally considered to be sinks of marine zooplankton, mainly due to the predation by scleractinian corals and other planktivores. The present study aims to evaluate the zooplankton community of a coastal reef in two specific environments: the reef edge and open-water channels between patch reefs. Sampling was carried out at two patch reefs that border the Tamandare coastal lagoon system (Pernambuco State, Brazil). Two passive stationary nets (64 mu m mesh size) were used: the Reef Edge Net (REN) and the Channel Midwater Neuston Net (CMNN). Sampling was performed simultaneously at both reefs during eight nocturnal sampling campaigns, always at new moon ebb tides. Zooplankton was classified by ``origin{''} (estuarine, reef, neritic and neritic/estuarine). During all campaigns and at both sites, a significant buildup of zooplankton at the reefs was observed. Reef edges showed significantly higher abundance (77,579 +/- 73,985 ind. m(-3)) and biomass (48.9 +/- 45.5 mg C m(-3)) of zooplankton compared to open-water channels (9982 +/- 11,427 ind. m(-3) and 11.4 +/- 21.9 mg C m(-3), respectively). A total of 65 taxonomic groups were identified. Copepods were the most abundant group with a contribution of 69\% for total zooplankton abundance, followed by foraminiferans, gastropod veligers, appendicularians, cirripedians nauplii, and polychaete larvae. Copepods from neritic/estuarine environments dominated the reef edges in both relative abundance and relative biomass (91\% and 88\%, respectively). The unexpectedly high abundance of copepods and other holoplankton at the reef edges, when compared to Indo-Pacific and Caribbean reefs, is probably due to very low cover of corals and other zooplanktivorous sessile animals (< 0.2\%) on these coastal reefs, which leads to a very low predation mortality for zooplankters. Also, we propose that the reduced water column above the reef top leads to a buildup of very high densities in these environments",NA,NA,NA,

The possible benefits of protection from fishing were particularly evaluated by comparing sites with varying levels of protection. Two reefs within the well-enforced no-take area of the National Marine Park of Abrolhos (Parcel dos Abrolhos and California) were compared with two unprotected coastal reefs (Sebasti√£o Gomes and Pedra de Leste) and one legally protected but poorly enforced coastal reef (the ‚Äúpaper park‚Äù of Timbebas Reef). The fish biomass was lower and the fleshy macroalgal cover was higher in the unprotected reefs compared with the protected areas. The unprotected and protected reefs had similar seawater chemistry. Lower vibrio CFU counts were observed in the fully protected area of California Reef. Metagenome analysis showed that the unprotected reefs had a higher abundance of archaeal and viral sequences and more bacterial pathogens, while the protected reefs had a higher abundance of genes related to photosynthesis. Similar to other reef systems in the world, there was evidence that reductions in the biomass of herbivorous fishes and the consequent increase in macroalgal cover in the Abrolhos Bank may be affecting microbial diversity and abundance. Through the integration of different types of ecological data, the present study showed that protection from fishing may lead to greater reef health. The data presented herein suggest that protected coral reefs have higher microbial diversity, with the most degraded reef (Sebasti√£o Gomes) showing a marked reduction in microbial species richness. It is concluded that ecological conditions in unprotected reefs may promote the growth and rapid evolution of opportunistic microbial pathogens.",NA,NA,NA,

WE SAMPLED THE UPPER-SHORE LEVELS OF A SUBTROPICAL COASTLINE IN  SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL TO EXAMINE THE TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF PROPAGULE  RELEASE FOR THE COMMON BARNACLE CHTHAMALUS BISINUATUS AND THE PERIWINKLE  NODILITTORINA LINEOLATA. THE RELEASE TIMING IN BOTH SPECIES WAS VERY  CONSISTENT BETWEEN SITES A FEW KILOMETERS APART. BARNACLES RELEASED  NAUPLII IN A RHYTHMIC PATTERN MOSTLY COINCIDING WITH NEAP TIDES WHEN  THE SPEED OF TIDAL CURRENTS WAS LOWEST. THERE WAS NO VARIATION IN  PROPAGULE RELEASE IN RELATION TO DIEL OR FLOOD-EBB TIDAL CYCLES.  PERIWINKLES RELEASED PROPAGULES IN A VERY IRREGULAR PATTERN WHICH  REMARKABLY MATCHED A TIME SERIES OF WAVE HEIGHTS. EGG CAPSULES WERE  RELEASED DURING PERIODS OF ROUGH SEAS WHEN ONSHORE SURFACE CURRENTS  WERE EXPECTED TO PREVAIL. EGGS WERE RELEASED MOSTLY DURING EBB TIDES  AND THERE WAS NO DIEL VARIATION.

WHEN NOT   PROPERLY HANDLED, THESE CONFLICTS CAN UNDERMINE PRESERVATION OBJECTIVES.   DUE TO THE HUMAN POPULATION INCREASE AND THE EMERGENCE OF NEW MPAS   AROUND THE WORLD, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN MAN AND NATURE TENDS TO   INCREASE. THE ABROLHOS BANK, WHERE THE ABROLHOS NATIONAL MARINE PARK   (ABROLHOS N.M.P) IS LOCATED, IS HOME TO THE LARGEST AND RICHEST CORAL   REEF AREAS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC. THIS REGION HAS AROUND 20,000   FISHERMEN WHO EXPLOIT THE FISHING GROUNDS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS. THE   IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ABROLHOS N.M.P LED TO A CHANGE IN THE LIFESTYLE OF   FISHERMEN IN THE SURROUNDING REGION. THESE CHANGES HAVE GENERATED   CONFLICTS BETWEEN FISHERMEN AND THIS MPA. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF   THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE RESILIENCE OF THE SOCIOECOLOGICAL   SYSTEM (SES) OF THE ABROLHOS N.M.P SURROUNDINGS, THROUGH THE VISION AND   THE STRATEGIES ADOPTED BY THE FISHERMEN OF THE REGION, USING THE Q   METHODOLOGY. FOR THIS STUDY, THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE FISHERMEN OF THE   ABROLHOS N.M.P SURROUNDINGS WERE INTERVIEWED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT   THE RESILIENCE OF THE SES VARIES ACCORDING TO THE FISHING SCALE. THE SES   THAT SMALL-SCALE FISHERMEN ARE A PART OF HAVE SHOWN TO BE LESS RESILIENT   AND ALSO HAVE MORE CONFLICTS WITH THIS MPA. FOR THEM, THE LOSS OF OLD   FISHING GROUNDS THAT BECAME PART OF THE MPA HAS COMPROMISED THEIR WORK.   MEANWHILE, THE SSE THAT THE MEDIUM SCALE FISHERMEN ARE PART OF HAS SHOWN   TO BE MORE RESILIENT, ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO HAVE CONFLICTS WITH THE AMP.   FOR THEM, THE LOSS OF A FISHERY REPRESENTED AN ADVANTAGE FOR THE   MAINTENANCE OF FISHING IN THE REGION.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS SUCH AN EXAMPLE THAT  REQUIRES THE USE OF GIS TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS AND DECISION BY MANAGERS AND  ENROLLED COMMUNITY OF PROTECTED AREAS. IN THIS SPECIFIC FIELD A  CHALLENGE THAT REMAINS IS TO BUILD A GIS THAT CAN BE DYNAMICALLY FED  WITH DATA ALLOWING RESEARCHERS AND OTHER AGENTS TO RECOVER ACTUAL AND  UP TO DATE INFORMATION. IN SOME CASES DATA IS ACQUIRED IN SEVERAL WAYS  AND COME FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE PROPOSE A  TOOL THAT INCLUDES A MODEL FOR SPATIAL DATA TREATMENT ON THE WEB THAT  WE NAMED SYSTEM FOR INTEGRATED MONITORING - SIM. THE RESEARCH ISSUES  INVOLVED IN THIS TOOL START WITH THE DEALING OF SATELLITE IMAGES OF  PROTECTED AREAS. IT IS FOLLOWED BY ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING OF  DIFFERENT TYPES OF VIDEO AND IMAGES AS SMALL FORMAT AERIAL IMAGES OR  SIMPLY SFAI ACQUIRED BY A RADIO CONTROLLED HELICOPTER USED FOR  CONSTRUCTION OF MOSAICS TO BE FED IN THE GIS AND UNDERWATER  GEO-REFERENCED PICTURES ACQUIRED IN-LOCO BY RESEARCHERS FOR BETTER  ANALYZING A GIVEN AREA.

CAMARA EM 2019 MAR ENV RES,2019,Hierarchical partitioning of fish diversity and scale-dependent environmental effects in tropical coastal ecosystems,Hierarchical spatial structure Scale dependence Additive partitioning Multiplicative partitioning Multi-scale environmental effects Land use Isolation Fish Coastal zone,"The spatial structure of the fish diversity and site-scale and landscape-scale environmental effects were investigated across hierarchical levels in tropical coastal ecosystems. Total diversity (Œ≥) was hierarchically partitioned into Œ± and Œ≤ components using both the additive and multiplicative methods. A model selection based on the AICc was applied to generalized linear mixed models relating diversity measures to environmental variables and including random effects for hierarchical levels and season. Short-term seasonal effects were negligible. Spatial effects were more relevant at the site level and negligible at the subregion level, due to the high spatial heterogeneity and the natural pooling of ecosystems, respectively. Site-scale environmental effects were more relevant at the subregion level, with eutrophic conditions (continental influence) favoring the species richness (Œ± and Œ≥) and higher absence of species (Œ≤A) in oligotrophic conditions (marine influence). At the system level, the positive effect of the distance from the ocean on Œ≥ and higher Œ≤A in oligotrophic conditions reinforced the positive continental influence on fish diversity. Environmental homogenization processes were most likely associated with the negative effect of the pasture cover on Œ± at the system level, and Œ≥ and Œ≤A at the site level. The negative effect of the forest cover on the later diversity measure evidenced its relevance to maintain richer but more similar assemblages, whereas the positive continental influence was most likely due to the loss of stenohaline marine species. This study evidenced that disentangling spatial, land use, and marine vs. continental effects on diversity components is critical to understand the primary determinants of the fish diversity in tropical coastal ecosystems.",NA,NA,NA,

STUDY OF THE  SEQUENCE GEOMETRIES REVEAL SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT GEOMETRIC RESPONSES  TO CHANGES IN RELATIVE SEA LEVEL OF INTERVALS DOMINATED BY CARBONATES TO  INTERVALS DOMINATED BY SILICICLASTICS. USING THE GEOMETRICAL SHELF BREAK  AS A REFERENCE POINT AGGRADATION AND PROGRADATION RATES FOR THE  CARBONATE AND SILICICLASTIC DEPOSITIONAL SYSTEMS WERE MEASURED. IN  SILICICLASTICS THE LATERAL POSITION OF THE MARGIN REMAINS ROUGHLY  STATIONARY WITH RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL RISES IN THE ORDER OF 30 M/MY. AT  HIGHER RATES THE MARGIN RETREATS AT LOWER RATES IT PROGRADES. CARBONATE  MARGINS REMAIN STATIONARY OR SLIGHTLY PROGRADATIONAL EVEN WITH RELATIVE  SEA-LEVEL RISES OF UP TO 100 M/MY THE FASTEST RATES OBSERVED IN THIS  STUDY. THIS ILLUSTRATES THE STRONG TENDENCY OF CARBONATE PLATFORMS TO  STACK THEIR MARGINS AND KEEP UP WITH RELATIVE RISES IN SEA LEVEL RATHER  THAN GRADUALLY RETREAT LANDWARD AS DO SILICICLASTICS. THIS OBSERVATION  MAY EXPLAIN WHY CARBONATE PLATFORMS PREFERENTIALLY TRY TO DEFEND A  MARGIN PRIOR TO ULTIMATE BACKSTEPPING. THE HIGH AGGRADATION POTENTIAL OF  CARBONATE MARGINS ALSO GIVES ONLAP AND DOWNLAP TERMINATION PATTERNS ON  SEISMIC PROFILES WHERE CARBONATE PLATFORMS DEVELOP ON SLOPING  SILICICLASTIC SHELVES. THE RESULTING UNCONFORMITIES ARE A RESULT OF  DIFFERENCES IN SEDIMENT DISPERSAL BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS AND NOT  NECESSARILY FROM CHANGES OF RELATIVE SEA LEVEL. C 2005 ELSEVIER B.V.

CAMPOS P 2020 ENVIRON RES,2020,Can Palythoa cf. variabilis biochemical patterns be used to predict coral reef conservation state in Todos Os Santos Bay,Soft coral; Oxidative stress; Phase shift,"Coral reefs are one of the most diverse, complex and productive marine ecosystems on the planet. Global climate change and other anthropogenic impacts have had a strong impact on the equilibrium of these ecosystems and causing the denominated ``coral reef crisis {''}. One consequence of coral reef crisis is the phase shift in reef communities, where scleractinian corals responsible for the bioconstruction of the coralline building are replaced by macroalgae or soft corals. In Todos os Santos Bay (TSB) there is a rare case of phase shift caused by the soft coral Palythoa cf. variabilis. When in population outbreak, this coral species becomes dominant and leads to loss of scleractinian coral cover. Palythoa genus establishes a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium, that is changed in phase shift coral reefs, but other alterations remain unknown. In this study, the metabolism (oxidative damage, antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes, electron transport chain activity and photosynthetic pigments) of P. cf. variabilis from reefs in different conservation states was studied to identify and relate if changes that may occur in the biochemical and metabolism of the coral might trigger the population outbreak, identify parameters recognizing if corals are in stress and assess if one or more parameters can reflect the level of stress organisms are experiencing. The results obtained evidenced a clear distinction in the biochemistry and metabolism of corals from conserved sites and sites in phase shift, and these changes may be the trigger for population outbreak. Some of the parameters were able to discriminate the level of stress corals are experiencing and may allow to recognize the most at-risk coral reefs that need immediate intervention and prevent the entry into or revert P. cf. variabilis outbreak and phase shift in coral reefs. Actions like these can be of vital importance for the preservation of TSB coral reefs and possibly for other threatened reefs worldwide",NA,NA,NA,

IN THE SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC TWO  SCLERACTINIAN CORALS TUBASTRAEA COCCINEA AND T. TAGUSENSIS HAVE BEEN  INTRODUCED BY OPPORTUNISTIC COLONIZATION IN 1980 AND ARE NOW WIDESPREAD  ALONG MORE THAN 3500 KM OF COASTLINE. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INVASION  PROCESS AND THE ROLE OF VECTORS IN SPREADING THESE SPECIES WE SAMPLED  306 AND 173 COLONIES OF T. COCCINEA AND T. TAGUSENSIS FROM INVADED  SITES POSSIBLE VECTORS AND ONE NATIVE POPULATION. ANALYSES REVEALED A  HIGHER DIVERSITY OF MULTI-LOCUS GENOTYPES MLGS ON VECTORS SUGGESTING  THAT THEY WERE CONTAMINATED PRIOR TO THEIR ARRIVAL IN THE SOUTHWESTERN  ATLANTIC AND A HIGH PROPORTION OF CLONES AT INVADED SITES WITH FEW  GENOTYPES SPREAD OVER SIMILAR TO 2000 KM. THIS BROAD DISTRIBUTION IS  MOST LIKELY A RESULT OF SECONDARY INTRODUCTIONS THROUGH THE TRANSPORT OF  CONTAMINATED VECTORS. RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THE OCCURRENCE OF MULTIPLE  INVASIONS MAINLY IN THE NORTHERNMOST SITES. IN SUMMARY CLONALITY  SECONDARY INTRODUCTIONS AND MULTIPLE INVASIONS ARE THE MAIN REASONS FOR  THE BROAD SPREAD AND INVASIVE SUCCESS OF TUBASTRAEA SPP. IN THE  SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC. CONSEQUENTLY THE CORRECT CONTROL OF VECTORS IS  THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION OF NEW  INVASIONS.,NA,NA,NA,

WE RECORDED  5005 FISHES BELONGING TO 76 SPECIES AND 31 FAMILIES. AS EXPECTED THE  MEAN ALPHA DIVERSITY OF RARE SPECIES D-0 DOUBLED FROM CONTROL TO HIGH  COMPLEXITY AREAS AND DECREASED BY HALF FROM DAY TO NIGHT. THE DIVERSITY  OF TYPICAL SPECIES CD ALSO DOUBLED FROM CONTROL TO HIGH COMPLEXITY  AREAS BUT DID NOT REDUCE AT NIGHT. COMPLEXITY AND DIEL PERIOD DID NOT  HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DIVERSITY OF DOMINANT SPECIES D-2. NO  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPLEXITY AND ALPHA DIVERSITY WAS WEAKENED AT  NIGHT. BETA DIVERSITY OF THE THREE DIVERSITY ORDERS SIGNIFICANTLY  DIFFERED FROM 1 TOTALLY HOMOGENEOUS VESSEL REEF INDICATING THAT  COMPLEXITY UNDERLIES PATTERNS OF BETA DIVERSITY.

We used the Marine Rapid Assessment Protocol at 42 sites to gather information on environmental variables and species in six subtidal marine groups. We determined ‚Äúsingular‚Äù sites as the regions harbouring higher numbers of rare species. Then, we estimated the roles of species loss and turnover on the observed total variation among sites. We used Generalized Linear Model to partition the relative importance of the selected environmental factors in driving variation in species richness and singularity. The singularity index and richness showed that the bay could be divided into three subregions for subtidal communities. Richness and rarity were structured at different spatial scales and associated with environmental variables related to water productivity and nutrients but varied among taxonomic groups. Community variation over space was largely associated with turnover of species. Higher singularity and richness on the western side of the bay and around the main island suggested that these regions should be conservation priorities, but high species turnover across the whole bay indicated that portions of the central channel should be included in conservation strategies. This draws attention to the importance of community variation rather than just species numbers in conservation and management planning.

The marine aquarium trade (MAT) is the source of some of the world's worst aquatic invasions, inflicting multimillion-dollar losses in infected regions. In the Southwestern Atlantic (SWA), two Indo-Pacific coral species were recently introduced as a result of the MAT and already dominate the substrate at the introduction site in Southeastern Brazil (Praia Vermelha, Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro State). Herein, based on morphological and molecular evidence, we report a Caribbean native coral species likely introduced by the MAT in Praia Vermelha, Erythropodium caribaeorum (Duchassaing \& Michelotti 1860). While the eradication of coral species that already have a pest status in the SWA is unlikely, we propose that the eradication of the three species still contained to their introduction sites, including E. caribaeorum, is still feasible and depends on a rapid and integrated embracement of the task by core stakeholders.

In addition to the molecular evidence, our results show morphological differences that distinguish the Atlantic lineage from that of the Pacific: anal fin, usually, with eight rays (vs. generally nine rays in Pacific); 13-15 scales below the lateral line, rarely 12 (vs. 12 scales below the lateral line, rarely 13 in Pacific), posterior margin of the maxilla robust with a slightly angled end (vs. smaller maxilla with moderately convex extremity), and presence of a spot on the preoperculum, broad and robust, with no definite shape (vs. narrow spot, with anterior extremity tuned and posterior straight, resembling a triangle in Pacific).

IN BRAZIL K.  ALVAREZII AQUACULTURE IS ALLOWED IN 300 KM OF THE SOUTHEASTERN COAST.  THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE RISK OF INVASION OF THIS  SPECIES ALONG THE ENTIRE BRAZILIAN COAST TO DESIGN PUBLIC POLICIES AND  TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH AQUACULTURE. THE RISK  ANALYSIS WAS BASED ON K. ALVAREZII SUITABILITY MODELS GARP AND  MAXENT CORAL REEF PRESENCE SUBSTRATE PREFERENCES FOR ESTABLISHMENT  AND THE PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE OF NINE SPECIES OF HERBIVORES THAT ARE  POTENTIAL FEEDERS. AN INVASIBILITY INDEX WAS CREATED FROM THESE  PARAMETERS AND PUBLISHED DATA OF FIELD EXPERIMENTS WERE USED FOR  CALIBRATION. THE MAXIMUM VALUES OF SUITABILITY CORRESPONDED TO REGIONS  WITH LOW TEMPERATURE RANGES LOW NITRATE AVAILABILITY HIGH IRRADIANCE  AND HIGH SALINITY. THREE INVASION RISK CLASSES WERE ESTABLISHED. THE  AREAS OF HIGH RISK ARE THE EASTERN AND NORTHEASTERN REGIONS WHERE THE  MAIN ATLANTIC CORAL REEFS ARE FOUND. THIS IS A PRIORITY AREA FOR GLOBAL  MARINE CONSERVATION. K. ALVAREZII INTRODUCTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED IN  THIS AREA AND THE CULTIVATION OF NATIVE SPECIES MUST BE PRIORITIZED. THE  AREA OF MEDIUM RISK IS MAINLY IN THE NORTHERN REGION WHERE LOCAL FIELD  SCALE EXPERIMENTS ARE RECOMMENDED BEFORE WIDESPREAD INTRODUCTION. THE  AREA OF LOW RISK IS THE SOUTHEASTERN REGION WHERE K. ALVAREZII FARMING  HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED SINCE 2004 WITH NO EVIDENCE OF INVASION. HOWEVER  CONSIDERING THE HIGH CAPACITY OF ACCLIMATION OF THIS SPECIES PERMANENT  MONITORING IS RECOMMENDED EVEN IN AREAS HAVING A LOW RISK OF INVASION.  STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE WE STATE THE RELEVANCE OF OUR PAPER IN  COMMERCIAL AQUACULTURE SINCE WE PRESENTED A CONSISTENT ENVIRONMENTAL  RISK ANALYSIS FOR K. ALVAREZII THAT ACCORDING TO FAO IS THE MOST  CULTIVATED SEAWEED IN THE WORLD. OUR AIM IS TO CONTRIBUTE FOR  DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE SEAWEED AQUACULTURE SUBSIDING DATA TO  MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH K. ALVAREZII INTRODUCTION.  THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS ALSO CAN BE ADAPTED TO OTHER COUNTRIES. OUR  RESULTS INDICATE SAFE AREAS TO EXTEND K.

Most southwestern Atlantic reefs are characterized by high sedimentation. However there are no temporal series of sediment deposition rates. We evaluated sediment deposition the sediment carbonate composition and coral and zoanthid covers on six reefs in Brazil over four-years. Sediment deposition rates varied from near zero to 233 mg cm-2¬†day-1 with peaks between August and December and yearly averages ranging from nine to 104 mg cm-2¬†day-1. Deposition rates presented site-specific correlations with wind indicating that resuspension must be a major factor. The presence of carbonates varied from 38% to 90% with two sites showing seasonal differences. Benthic communities were fairly similar among sites but the analyses suggested particular frequencies at each site. There was no significant correlation between sediment and benthic communities. However¬†Palythoa caribaeorum¬†usually occur in high sediment deposition areas. Our results did not corroborate previous data that suggested that a 10 mg cm-2¬†day-1would be a ""critical limit for coral survival"".

THE SAME IS TRUE FOR SYCETTUSA HASTIFERA ANOTHER CALCAREAN SPONGE WITH  A WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION. DATA ON THE ECOLOGY OF THESE SPECIES COULD  HELP IN ELUCIDATING THEIR POTENTIAL TO BECOME A THREAT IF THEY ARE FOUND  TO BE EXOTIC SPECIES IN BRAZIL. IN THE PRESENT WORK WE STUDIED HABITAT  SELECTION GROWTH AND MORTALITY OF EARLY JUVENILES OF P.MAGNA AND  HABITAT SELECTION OF S.HASTIFERA IN A MARINE RESERVE FROM SOUTHEASTERN  BRAZIL WHERE THESE SPECIES ARE ABUNDANT IN THE BENTHIC COMMUNITY.  GRANITE PLATES WERE USED FOR HABITAT SELECTION ANALYSIS VARYING IN  SUBSTRATE INCLINATION VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL AND EXPOSURE TO LIGHT  AND HYDRODYNAMISM EXPOSED AND SHELTERED. TO ANALYSE THE GROWTH AND  MORTALITY RATES SPONGES WERE MAPPED AND THEN MEASURED ONCE A WEEK FOR  10WEEKS. IF A MONITORED SPONGE WAS NOT FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT  WAS CONSIDERED TO BE DEAD. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH P.MAGNA AND  S.HASTIFERA ARE CAPABLE OF INHABITING SUBSTRATES EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT  ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THEY SHOWED HABITAT PREFERENCES.

NINETY-EIGHT OF THE 151 VIBRIO ISOLATES FELL WITHIN THE  VIBRIO CORE GROUP ACCORDING TO PARTIAL 16S RDNA SEQUENCES. WE PERFORMED  THE SEQUENCING OF RECA AND PYRH GENES OF ALL VIBRIO ISOLATES.

THERE WAS A  COMPLETE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GROUPING BASED ON REP-PCR AND  CONCATENATED SEQUENCES OF PYRH RECA AND 16S RDNA BUT THE PYRH GENE HAS  THE HIGHEST DISCRIMINATORY POWER FOR VIBRIO SPECIES IDENTIFICATION.

Hence, the interest on deeper reefs has happened at a time when shallow reefs are undergoing unprecedented changes. Here we investigated the hypothesis that fish community differed from shallow to deeper reefs due to factors apart from habitat structure and quality and therefore discuss for the first-time insights of a ‚Äúdeep refuge hypothesis‚Äù from Brazilian reefs. We collected data on fish community, benthic community and physiological conditions of two coral species on shallow (< 6 m) and deep reefs (> 25 m). No significant difference on substratum composition was observed comparing sites and depths. Additionally, physiological data on corals also showed similar oxidative status and growth conditions when comparing the two-coral species in shallow and deep reefs. Conversely, our study demonstrated strong differences on reef fish communities in terms of abundance, species richness, trophic groups, size classes and groups of interest when comparing shallow and deeper reefs. Fish abundance was 2-fold higher and species richness was up to 70% higher on deeper reefs. Also, a significant difference was observed comparing trophic groups of reef fish. Macrocarnivore, Mobile invertebrate feeders, Planktivores, Sessile Invertebrates Feeders and Roving Herbivores were more abundant on deeper reefs. On the other hand, Territorialist Herbivores almost exclusively dominated shallow reefs. Strong differences were also observed comparing the abundance of reef fish groups of interest and their respective size classes between shallow and deeper reefs. Ornamental, Great Herbivores and Groupers showed clear differences, with higher abundances being observed in deeper reefs. Considering size classes, larger individuals (> 15 cm) of Great Herbivores, Groupers and Snapper were uniquely recorded at deeper reefs. Additionally, individuals with > 30 cm were recorded almost exclusively on deeper reefs for all the analyzed groups of interest. Our findings suggest that fishing pressure on the target species may be attenuated on deeper reefs, and these regions may therefore be considered as areas of refuge from shallow water impacts. Therefore, the likely potential for deeper reefs protect species from natural or anthropogenic disturbances increases the attention of marine conservation planning and resource management on including deeper reefs in protected areas.",UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO UFPE,"PEREIRA, PHC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO UFPE, DEPT OCEANOGRAFIA, CTG AV ARQUITETURA S-N,CIDADE UNIV, BR-50670901 RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL",CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES),

Yet, few studies have attempted to analyze the influence of depth on reef fish escape behavior across distinct size classes. By using behavioral response as a measure for prey wariness, the present study analyzed flight initiation distance (FID) for three fishery target and one non-target reef fish species on shallow and deeper reefs in South Atlantic Ocean (Multiple use MPA Costa dos Corais, Pernambuco State). We hypothesized that fish on shallow reefs would have higher FID and detect the human approach sooner and flee at a large distance than individuals in deeper reefs, which would have a late detection, allowing a closer approach. During our field experiment, flight initiation distances average was higher at shallow reefs for three analyzed species, yet each species had specific responses according to individual size classes. For two fishery target speciesE. adscensionis and C. fulva,two intermediate size classes presented higher flight distances at shallow than deeper reefs. However,S. axillarea target parrotfish, demonstrated an unexpected trend with higher FID on deeper reefs for smaller size classes. Interestingly, the non-target species, have also shown differences on wariness across the two analyzed size classes, with higher FID on shallow than deeper reefs. Our results suggest that fish on shallow reefs would detect the human approach sooner and flee at a large distance than individuals in deeper reefs; however, fish response to human presence according to depth is size classes and species dependent.

SURFACE AND DEEP WATER  FROM 5 CONTRASTING COASTAL AREAS WERE SAMPLED 13 TIMES DURING THE  SPRING/SUMMER AND IN THE FALL/WINTER PERIODS TO USE TWO-WAY ANALYSIS OF  VARIANCE COMPARING THE MEASURED VARIABLES IN FUNCTION OF SEASON AND  DEPTH. NORTHEASTERN WIND WAS PREDOMINANT DURING BOTH SEASONS BUT IT WAS  MORE INTENSE DURING THE SPRING/SUMMER PERIOD WHEN WATER TEMPERATURE WAS  COLDER AND CONCENTRATION OF NUTRIENTS PEAKED. SOUTHWESTERN WIND WAS MORE  COMMON DURING THE FALL/WINTER PERIOD AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH COLD FRONTS  THAT DECREASED WATER SALINITY INNER THE BAY.

Recruitment . Benthic complexity . Predation . SW Atlantic,"Branching scleractinians provide fish with critical refuge against predation. While in the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific regions they are conspicuous elements of the reef community, in the tropical Southwestern Atlantic (Brazil) branching corals are lacking and massive forms dominate. The only branching forms that occur in Brazil are stinging fire-corals of genus Millepora (Hydrozoa). Preliminary observations showed that several fish species seek refuge within fire-corals in Brazil, suggesting that they may replace the functional role played by scleractinians in other regions. Here, the association of fishes to individual fire-coral colonies (Millepora alcicornis and M. brasiliensis) and the relationship between fire-coral cover and fish abundance was studied in eastern Brazil. A total of 38 fish species from 18 families (37 % of the regional species pool) were recorded within firecorals. Most records were of relatively small-bodied fishes and juveniles of large-bodied fishes. Comparative observations between day and night indicated that fire-corals are used as sleeping sites by a few species. Volume of colonies was positively correlated with fish abundance and species richness. Over a large spatial scale (tens of kilometers) fire-coral cover had a positive and significant influence on the abundance of three fish species only (Abudefduf saxatilis, Acanthurus coeruleus and Microspatodon chrysurus). Although physical attributes of colonies and fire-coral cover may help to account for some of the spatial variability in fish abundance, fire-corals may be considered as an alternative instead of a critical microhabitat for fish. The advantages and drawbacks of living in a branching and stinging environment are discussed.",UNIV FED PARAIBA,"FRANCINI, RB (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED PARAIBA, DEPT ENGN \& MEIO AMBIENTE, RUA MANGUEIRA S-N, BR-58297000 RIO TINTO, PB, BRAZIL",CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO AND CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL (CI); CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); FAPERJFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ),

Its unique position and singular seascape make the PML an important stepping-stone for marine organisms between the Brazilian and Caribbean provinces. Yet, due to its distance from the shore, high tidal amplitude, and strong currents associated with a series of pinnacles exposed during low spring tides, the PML is one of the least studied reefs in the Western South Atlantic. Here, we integrated sessile benthic community data, fish assemblage surveys, and remote filming of fish interactions to establish the most complete community assessment of the PML reefs to date. In our surveys, we documented 78 sessile benthic taxa, with a taxonomic dominance of macroalgae (54 taxa), including two new occurrences of sponges for the North Brazilian Shelf, as well as four endemic species, such as the fire coral Millepora laboreli. The fish assemblage comprised 59 reef fish species, with biomass dominated mainly by large carnivorous species (e.g., groupers and snappers). Intra- and interspecific interactions were dominated by herbivorous fishes, particularly underpinned by grazing behavior and chasing by territorial species. The considerably high biomass and large-bodied species found in our surveys is rarely seen elsewhere in the Western South Atlantic, suggesting a low level of fishing compared to most other places, and only a few changes were observed in the fish assemblages since the first assessment made in 1998. We also highlight the usefulness of an integrated approach for continued assessment of Western South Atlantic reefs, particularly given emerging threats from mining and oil exploration, and the heavy traffic of commercial vessels in the region. Our findings support the PML as an area of critical conservation interest for reef systems, emphasizing the need for continued enforcement of this marine protected area and its integration in long-term plans of offshore oil and gas development projects",UNIV FED FLUMINENSE,"CORDEIRO, CAMM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED FLUMINENSE, DEPT BIOL MARINHA, LAB ECOL \& CONSERVACAO AMBIENTES RECIFAIS, CAIXA POSTAL 100644, BR-24001970 NITEROI, RJ, BRAZIL",FAPERJ - FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO RIO DE JANEIROFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ) [111.711/2012]; FUNDACAO O BOTICARIO DE PROTECAO A NATUREZA [0898/20111]; CAPES - COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR FOR A SCHOLARSHIP GRANT (CAMMC)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL DECRA FELLOWSHIPAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL [DE120102459]; ECOHUB,
CORDEIRO CAMM 2020 FRONT MAR SCI,2020,The Biophysical Controls of Macroalgal Growth on Subtropical Reefs,marginal reefs; grazers; upwelling; exclusion experiments,"The importance of macro-grazers in controlling macroalgal cover has long been recognized on tropical and temperate reefs, with fishes of primary importance on the former and sea urchins on the latter. However, the functional role of herbivorous urchins and fishes on subtropical marginal reefs remains poorly explored. To evaluate the relative importance of fishes and urchins on marginal subtropical reefs, this study used exclusion devices (excluding all grazers, fishes, or urchins) at two depths (1-2, 5-6 m) on Brazilian rocky reefs. Depth influenced responses within cages, with shallow sites changing from patchy barrens (dominated by crustose coralline algae) to epilithic algae-dominated within exclusion treatments, and sea urchins being the primary driver of benthic dynamics. In deeper water, the growth and senescence cycle of Sargassum species drove benthic dynamics and was associated with the season of higher intensity of upwelling events. No clear influence of herbivorous fishes was detected on benthic cover at either depth, despite biomasses similar to comparable tropical reefs where they do control macroalgal populations. Thus, abiotic factors seem to be a strong driver of benthic dynamics in the studied region, and top-down processes act only at shallow depths. Consequently, despite Brazilian subtropical communities being dominated by tropical species, the ecological drivers of these reefs may be more similar to temperate systems",UNIV FED FLUMINENSE,"CORDEIRO, CAMM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED FLUMINENSE, REEF SYST ECOL \& CONSERVAT LAB, NITEROI, RJ, BRAZIL",FUNDACAO ``O BOTICARIO'' DE PROTECAO A NATUREZA [0898/20111]; FAPERJ - FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO RIO DE JANEIROFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ) [111.711/2012]; COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR -BRASIL (CAPES)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES) [001]; CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); FAPERJFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ),

Pap,2020,First assessment on Southwestern Atlantic equatorial deep-sea coral communities,Brazil; Potiguar basin; Coral diversity; Octocorallia; Scleractinia; Antipatharia,"Deep-sea coral communities are poorly known in the Southwestern Atlantic (SWA), particularly in the equatorial/subequatorial latitudes embraced by the northeastern Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Such knowledge gap has lead to the idea that the latter has low species richness when compared to southern Brazilian regions. Recent studies, however, indicate the northeastern slope as highly suitable for deep-sea coral habitats. Herein, based on recent sampling efforts, we confirm that deep-sea coral richness in that region is higher than previously thought. Trawl surveys carried out in 2011 at the Potiguar Basin, Rio Grande do Norte State, yielded the identification of at least 51 coral species, including 28 octocorals, 16 scleractinians, and seven antipatharians, including five new records for the South Atlantic and 11 new occurrences for the northeastern Brazilian waters. Comprising 29 species, the upper slope communities (102-200 m) showed the highest richness. Species richness between northeastern and southern Brazil is briefly compared, indicating a decrease of species richness southwards. Since most of the studied area is under influence of the same water masses, proximity to the Caribbean fauna may explain the species richness found in the northern Brazilian external shelf and slope. Finally, we suggest that biogeographic units within the Brazilian upper and middle slope are closer to shallow-water provinces than to deep-sea ones",UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO,"CORDEIRO, RTS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO, POSGRAD BIOL ANIM, CTR CIENCIAS BIOL, DEPT ZOOL, AVE PROF MORAES REGO 1235, BR-50670420 RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL","BRAZILIAN ENERGY COMPANY, PETROBRAS; CONSELHO NACIONAL DE PESQUISA - CNPQ (PROTAX)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [562320/2010-5]; FACEPE - FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA DO ESTADO DE PERNAMBUCOFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA DO ESTADO DE PERNAMBUCO (FACEPE) [APQ-0828-2.04/12]; FACEPEFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA DO ESTADO DE PERNAMBUCO (FACEPE); CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ)",

In the state of Alagoas, coral reefs are abundant, but different human impacts occur when the reefs are located in urban settings. This study compared the diversity of macrobenthic organisms on five coral reefs on the urban coast of the city of Macei√≥, which are subject to different human impacts. Semi-quantitative estimates of the abundance of live specimens at each station on these reefs consisted of visual records obtained during five full low-tide periods from 2005 to 2007. Fifty taxa of macrobenthic organisms were analyzed, using cluster analysis (UPGMA, Bray-Curtis). The Jati√∫ca (50 species) and Ponta Verde (50 species) coral reefs were similar, with 0.2 for cluster analysis; both sites are impacted only by harvesters of seafood. The Paju√ßara (48 species) and Amores (47 species) coral reefs were similar, with 0.4 and 0.5, respectively; human impacts at these sites also include boat anchoring. Piscina Natural coral reef had the fewest macrobenthic species (13), with 0.7 for cluster analysis; human impacts on this reef include tourist activities and boat anchoring.

Approximately 10 colonies of each species were colleted from Tamandare and Gaibu beaches on the southern coast of Pernambuco State, Brazil, between August 1997 and April 1998 from depths of 0-4m. Densities of symbiotic algae were significantly lower in¬†S. stellata¬†than in any of the other species. Symboints of¬†Montastrea cavernosa¬†were significantly larger, and those of¬†Favia gravidasignificantly smaller, than symbionts from any of the other coral species. The results suggest that cell size may be a useful character in systematic studies of algal symbionts. Since ambient density and cell diameter also vary in a host species-specific manner in some species, these characters may also be useful in scleractinian coral systematics.",NA,NA,NA,

This study investigates the spatial and seasonal distribution of macroalgal species, which includes fleshy algae, turf algae and some geniculate and non-geniculate corallines, on two coastal and one offshore reef from Porto Seguro Bay, Brazil. Data were collected during the dry season (JulylAugust 1999) and2 the rainy season (FebruaryIMarch 2000), with samples being taken from the reef wall (at 1, 3 and 5 m depth) and from the reef flat. Macroalgal cover ranged from 33% (reef wall) to 60% (reef flat) on the coastal reefs, and from 36% (reef wall) to 50% (reef flat) on the offshore reef. The most diverse group was the Phaeophyta (19 taxa), followed by Rhodophyta (17 taxa) and then Chlorophyta (15 taxa). The largest number of infrageneric taxa was recorded during the rainy season (FebruaryIMarch 2000), the most abundant genera being Sargassum, Padina, Dictyota, Dictyosphaeria, Caulerpa and Amphiroa. Two species were recorded for the first time in the region: Tricleocarpa cylindrica (Rhodophyta, Galaxauraceae) and Avrainvillea longicaulis (Chlorophyta, Udoteaceae). Algal turf dominated the community structure at all reef sites and habitats. Fleshy algae are the second most conspicuous group on the reef flat in both coastal and offshore reefs. In terms of dominance, on the reef wall, corals and zoanthids are second to turf algae in the offshore reef and coastal reefs respectively.

TOURISM IS PRESENTLY INCREASING ITS  IMPACT ON RHODOLITH BEDS. GLOBAL WARMING AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ARE  ALSO DETERMINANT FACTORS IN FAUNAL CHANGE. OBJECTIVE TO ANALYSE THE  POLYCHAETE ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH RHODOLITH BEDS SUBJECT TO  DIFFERENT INTENSITIES OF TOURISTIC PRESSURE AT SEIXAS BEACH NE BRAZIL  WHERE TOURISM IS GRADUALLY INCREASING OVER TIME. METHODS EFFECTS WERE  EVALUATED AT TWO DEPTHS 1.5 M AND 4.0 M. SAMPLING WAS DONE EVERY TWO  MONTHS DURING 2015 ENCOMPASSING THE TWO MARKED SEASONS OF THE YEAR IN  THE REGION RAINY AND DRY. QUADRATS OF 15 X 15 CM WERE PLACED IN EACH  DEPTH DURING SAMPLING. ALL RHODOLITHS PRESENT WITHIN THE QUADRAT WERE  COLLECTED USUALLY FOUR TO FIVE RHODOLITHS.

FIRST A DETAILED BATHYMETRIC SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED REVEALING A  SUBMERGED REEF BANK MEASURING 18 KM LONG BY 1 KM WIDE PARALLEL TO THE  COASTLINE WITH A QUASI-HORIZONTAL TOP THAT VARIES FROM 0.5 M TO 4 M IN  DEPTH AT LOW TIDE. CLUSTER SIMILARITY BETWEEN 180 REEF PROFILES  INDICATES THAT IN 75\% OF THE AREA THE REEF GEOMETRY HAS A  CONFIGURATION SIMILAR TO A PLATFORM REEF WHEREAS IN 25\% OF THE AREA IT  RESEMBLES A FRINGING REEF. MEASUREMENTS OF WAVE PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS  WERE MADE AT TWO STATIONS EXPERIMENTS E1 AND E2 ACROSS THE REEF  PROFILE. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT WAVE HEIGHT WAS TIDALLY MODULATED AT  BOTH EXPERIMENTAL SITES. UP TO 67\% E1 AND 99.9\% E2 OF THE INCIDENT  WAVE HEIGHT IS ATTENUATED BY THE REEF TOP AT LOW TIDE. THIS TIDAL  MODULATION IS MOST APPARENT AT E2 DUE TO REEF GEOMETRY. AT THIS  LOCATION THE REEF TOP IS ONLY APPROXIMATELY 0.5 M DEEP DURING MEAN LOW  SPRING WATER AND ALMOST ALL INCIDENT WAVES BREAK ON THE OUTER REEF  EDGE. AT E1 THE REEF TOP DEPTH IS 4 M AND WAVES WITH HEIGHT RATIOS  SMALLER THAN THE CRITICAL BREAKING LIMIT ARE FREE TO PASS ONTO THE REEF  AND ARE PRIMARILY ATTENUATED BY BOTTOM FRICTION. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT  THE IMPORTANCE OF REEF GEOMETRY IN CONTROLLING WAVE CHARACTERISTICS OF  THE MAR BEACHES AND DEMONSTRATE ITS EFFECT ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE  ADJACENT COAST.

CREED JC 2019 BIOL INVAS,2019,Experimental evaluation of vinegar (acetic acid) for control of invasive corals (Tubastraea spp.) and a review of knowledge for other aquatic pests,Biological invasion Ùè∞ï Eradication Ùè∞ï Invasive species management Ùè∞ï Mortality trials Ùè∞ï Review,"Vinegar/acetic acid (V/AA) has been used to control unwanted marine and freshwater species. As a naturally occurring, available and ubiquitous substance most countries‚Äô legislations do not consider V/AA as harmful to the environment. We investigated the toxicity of household vinegar for the invasive corals Tubastraea coccinea and T. tagusensis (Dendrophylliidae), using injection (1, 2 or 4 of 10, 20 or 40 ml of vinegar) and immersion (full and half concentration; periods of 15, 30, 45, 60 or 120 min) treatments. For Tubastraea spp., immersion treatment always resulted in the death of the corals. In contrast, the lethality of injected vinegar depended on the number and volume of injections per coral colony; partially damaged colonies may be able to recover after vinegar injection. We also carried out a critical review and analysis regarding the use of V/AA in other aquatic species. V/AA has been tested and used as a biocide from virus and bacteria to fish; as for Tubastraea spp., three quarters of studies investigated the positive effects of V/AA as a biocide, the rest negative collateral effects on non-target species. We conclude that V/AA is an effective agent for killing Tubastraea spp. and most other aquatic organisms, can be applied using different methods and in different environments for controlling: (1) invasive or outbreak species; and (2) biofouling by native or invasive species on aquaculture systems and vectors. V/AA may be used applied pre-border to shipping vectors potentially transporting non-indigenous marine biofouling species such as Tubastraea spp.",INST BRASILEIRO BIODIVERSIDADE BRBIO,"CREED, JC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), INST BRASILEIRO BIODIVERSIDADE BRBIO, PROJETO CORAL SOL, BR-20031203 RIO DE JANEIRO, RJ, BRAZIL","FUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIROFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ) [E-26/010.003031/2014]; COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIORCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES) [1137/2010]; CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [CNPQ-305330/2010-1]; PROGRAMA DE INCENTIVO A PRODUCAO CIENTIFICA, TECNICA E ARTISTICA, PROCIENCIA/UERJ",

The beaches are divided into classes ranging from 1 (extremely attractive natural site) to 5 (unattractive urban areas). The data reflects the natural and anthropogenic characteristics of the coastal Noronha scenery, which have international relevance and are between classes 1‚Äì4. Class 3 and 4 beaches are associated with anthropogenic factors/parameters. Seasonal sedimentary stock variation has also contributed to the differences in classes between the seasons at some beaches. The results of this study are useful to create new perspectives for sustainable development based on the singularities of this touristic resource ‚Äì the landscape. The Fernando de Noronha Archipelago depends on its landscapes for tourism. Therefore, government policies should seek the sustainable management of its beaches, so as to ensure the protection of natural and cultural resources.",NA,NA,NA,
CRIVELLARO MS 2020 BIOL INVASIONS,2020,Fighting on the edge: reproductive effort and population structure of the invasive coral Tubastraea coccinea in its southern Atlantic limit of distribution following control activities,Marine invasion; Invasive species; Management; Mechanical control; Scleractinian corals; Propagules,"The detection and control of invasive alien species in marine ecosystems is especially challenging because it is difficult to visualize the full extension of an invasion, while control options are often limited. The invasive scleractinian coral Tubastraea coccinea have spread over 8000 km of the Atlantic coastline, from Florida in the USA to southern Brazil, mainly in association with oil and gas platforms. This invasive coral threatens endemic species, reduces native coral recruitment, and modifies communities and trophic interactions, posing a relevant threat to shallow Atlantic reefs. The main aim of our study was to assess the effectiveness of an ongoing T. coccinea control program by analyzing the results of control interventions on population structure and cover of the target species in its southern Atlantic limit of distribution. We also describe the reproductive effort of T. coccinea in a 12-month time span. Between 2012 and 2019, almost 14,000 colonies were removed, most of them of small size (< 5 polyps). The highest reproductive effort was observed in September. Changes in T. coccinea cover, population structure and potential local propagule supply were observed. Control activities led to a reduction in up to half the cover of the invaded area, maintained the majority of the population in non-reproductive sizes, and consequently lowered the potential local propagule supply. Our paper highlights the fundamental role of control in preventing the local spread of T. coccinea. Recommendations on management frequency and timing are also discussed in order to contribute to the improvement of management efficiency",NA,NA,NA,

Connectivity of MPAs through larval dispersal influences recruitment, population dynamics, genetic structure and biogeography in coral reef ecosystems. Connectivity of protected reef ecosystem in the ECS was investigated with a hydrodynamic model (ROMS) forcing an Individual Based Model (IBM‚ÄîIchthyop), and used groupers (genus Mycteroperca) as functional group. The hydrodynamic output from ROMS was compared with satellite data and showed good agreement with observed surface fields. Eggs were released, in IBM experiments, from April to September along six years (2002‚Äì2007) in five MPAs along the ECS. Intrannual variability in recruitment and self-recruitment of grouper larvae was observed, as well as a negative correlation of these population parameters with total Kinetic Energy (KE) used as a metric of the physical environment. Higher KE leads to increased offshore advection of larvae, reduced total recruitment and connectivity of MPAs. Our results indicate high and uni-directional connectivity between MPAs from north to south influenced by the Brazil Current flowing in the same direction.

THE AIM OF  THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE GENE FLOW AMONG THE POPULATIONS OF  THE SPECIES ALONG THE COAST OF BRAZIL BASED ON THE CONTROL REGION OF THE  MITOCHONDRIAL DNA. THE RESULTS INDICATE LOW HAPLOTYPE DIVERSITY  0.40-0.86 AND VERY LOW NUCLEOTIDE DIVERSITY 0.1-0.5\%. THEY ALSO  SHOW THAT THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF THE SPECIES VARIES CONSIDERABLY ALONG  THE COAST AND THAT THIS FINDING MAY BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE  IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITY AREAS FOR ITS CONSERVATION. THE POPULATION  ANALYSES INDICATE A LOW BUT SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF GENETIC STRUCTURING  PHIST = 0.111 PROBABLY DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF RARE HAPLOTYPES AT  SOME LOCATIONS ALTHOUGH THE GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN SITES WAS  NOT CORRELATED WITH GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE R=0.0501 P=0.7719 AND THE  SHARED HAPLOTYPES INDICATE THAT GENE FLOW OCCURS AMONG ALL LOCATIONS  ALONG THE BRAZILIAN COAST.

Although over time new methods have been developed for dietary assessment, no comparative analysis has ever been done. Using Octopus insularis as a model, we examined the results of three methods of diet analysis to understand how these techniques can influence study conclusions. Octopus diets were assessed through the analysis of (1) fresh prey remains deposited in midden piles, (2) digestive contents from the octopus crop and stomach, and (3) stable isotope data on the octopus and its potential food sources. The research was conducted at Rocas Atoll, a pristine oceanic reef off the northeastern coast of Brazil, with data from a coastal environment with substantial human impact (i.e. Rio do Fogo, northeastern Brazil) being evaluated as well. Overall, the three methods differed in the type of data they produced and the timescale represented, reflecting their own biases, the biology and behaviour of the octopus, and even the local oceanographic and other environmental conditions. We therefore provide a conceptual diagram to help researchers to consider the inherent aspects of each method when planning and performing studies of octopus diet, and also when interpreting study results",NA,NA,NA,

The aim was to test the hypothesis that the fish community structure changes seasonally, associated with seasonal changes in environmental conditions, and that changes occurred between the two yearly periods because of increased anthropogenic activities. The sampling protocol for the two surveys was identical. A total of 63 species was recorded, with 38 species occurring in 2002‚Äì2003, and 53 species in 2008‚Äì2009. The main changes in the mangrove's fish assemblage between 2002‚Äì2003 and 2008‚Äì2009 were (i) an increase in species richness, fish density and total biomass; and (ii) an increase in the zoobenthivorous species of gerreids Eucinostomus argenteus , Diapterus rhombeus and Ulaema lefroyi , and a decrease in the planktivorous clupeid Harengula clupeola . Other abundant species, such as the opportunistic atherinopsid. Atherinella brasiliensis , the detritivorous mullet Mugil liza and the zoobenthivorous pufferfish Sphoeroides testudineus did not differ in abundance between the two yearly periods. Ten species occurred only in 2002‚Äì2003, and 23 species only in 2008‚Äì2009, indicating significant changes in community structure over the 6‚Äêyear period. Seasonal changes in community structure were more conspicuous in 2008‚Äì2009, when species abundance and richness were greatest.

IN THIS STUDY THE EFFECTS OF  DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CO2-DRIVEN ACIDIFICATION OF SEAWATER CONTROL PH  8.1 MODERATE PH 7.8 INTERMEDIATE PH 7.5 AND SEVERE PH 7.2 ON THE  NET CALCIFICATION RATE AND ACTIVITY OF ENZYMES RELATED TO THE  CALCIFICATION PROCESS CA-ATPASE AND CARBONIC ANHYDRASE WERE EVALUATED  IN THE CALCAREOUS HYDROZOAN MILLEPORA ALCICORNIS. THE EXPERIMENT WAS RUN  FOR 30 D USING A MARINE MESOCOSM SYSTEM. NET CALCIFICATION RATIO WAS  SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN HYDROCORALS EXPOSED TO INTERMEDIATE SEAWATER  ACIDIFICATION FOR 16 D AND TO SEVERE SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION FOR 16 D OR  30 D COMPARED TO ANIMALS AT CONTROL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER ONLY  HYDROCORALS EXPOSED TO SEVERE SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION SHOWED LOWER NET  CALCIFICATION RATES THAN THOSE EXPOSED TO CONTROL CONDITIONS FOR 30 D.  IN ACCORDANCE THE ACTIVITIES OF ENZYMES INVOLVED IN THE CALCIFICATION  PROCESS MARKEDLY INCREASED IN HYDROCORALS EXPOSED TO REDUCED PH.  CA-ATPASE SEEMED TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION THAN  CARBONIC ANHYDRASE AS IT INCREASED IN HYDROCORALS EXPOSED TO  INTERMEDIATE AND SEVERE SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION FOR 30 D WHILE CARBONIC  ANHYDRASE ACTIVITY WAS ONLY STIMULATED UNDER SEVERE SEAWATER  ACIDIFICATION. THEREFORE OUR FINDINGS CLEARLY SHOW THAT THE HYDROCORAL  M. ALCICORNIS IS ABLE TO COPE TO SOME EXTENT WITH LONG-TERM CO2-DRIVEN  ACIDIFICATION OF SEAWATER PH AE<YEN> 7.5. IN ADDITION THEY SHOW THAT  CA-ATPASE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF CALCIFICATION RATE  UNDER SCENARIOS OF MODERATE AND INTERMEDIATE LEVELS OF SEAWATER  ACIDIFICATION. HOWEVER THE OBSERVED INCREASE IN CA-ATPASE AND CARBONIC  ANHYDRASE ACTIVITY WAS NOT ENOUGH TO COMPENSATE FOR THE EFFECTS OF  CO2-DRIVEN REDUCTION IN SEAWATER PH ON THE NET CALCIFICATION RATE OF THE  HYDROCORAL M.

Seismic profiles and jet-probe cores have shown a layer of calcareous sediments over 10 m thick that is formed mainly by the fragmentation of coralline algae. Video and scuba-diving observations demonstrate that dense aggregations of rhodoliths often change position on the sea bottom as a result of being dragged (‚Äúsail‚Äù effect) by foliose algae such as Sargassum, Dictyopteris, and Zonaria. The benthic fauna associated with rhodoliths or foliose macroalgae (Hydrozoa and Amphipoda) is dominated by polychaetes, ophiuroids, and molluscs. The sessile fauna is poorly represented, consisting of some sponge species. It was possible to verify the following dynamics: (i) in summer, foliose macroalgae and zoobenthos (phytal) are established upon the rhodoliths; (ii) in early and midwinter, epiphytic macroalgae are senescent; (iii) in late winter, storms disturb sediments on the sea bottom, burying living rhodoliths and removing the foliose algae; and (iv) in spring, a bloom of the bivalvia Pinctata pectinata occurs, overgrowing the bottom. The rhodoliths tend to remain on the seafloor (with 10% to 20% estimated buried and becoming permanently incorporated to the sediment mass). The sediment dynamics are strongly dominated by erosive phases related to storms.",NA,NA,NA,

THE  HISTORICAL RECORD OF EXPLORATION AND THE LACK OF A BASIN WIDE MANAGEMENT  FOR THE OFFSHORE INDUSTRY IN THE SW ATLANTIC THREATEN THE BIODIVERSITY  AND ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF VULNERABLE DEEP-SEA ECOSYSTEMS. THIS STUDY  IDENTIFIED HABITATS OF BIOLOGICAL INTEREST ON THE CAMPOS BASIN AND  PROPOSES RELEVANT AREAS FOR CONSERVATION EBSAS THAT COULD BE INCLUDED  IN THE FIRST DEEP-SEA MARINE PROTECTED AREA MPA NETWORK IN THE SOUTH  ATLANTIC. A TOTAL OF 42 BENTHIC HABITATS WERE MAPPED INCLUDING  COLD-WATER CORAL REEFS SUBMARINE CANYONS SOFT SEDIMENT SLOPE AND A  SEAMOUNT. THOSE HABITATS FILL CONSERVATION CRITERIA TO BE PROPOSED AS  EBSAS ALONG CAMPOS BASIN AND COULD SUPPORT A MPA NETWORK WITH A 5.5\%  OVERLAP 2330 KM2 TO CURRENT LEASED BLOCKS.

An inter-annual analysis (2002‚Äì2017) indicated that this bleaching event was related to anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) that led to the warmest year (2010) in this century (1 to 1.7 ¬∞C above average). Such anomalies caused heat stress (28.5‚Äì29.5 ¬∞C) in this equatorial environment that resulted in a bleaching event. Our results suggest that the increase in SST, low turbidity, and weak winds may have acted together to affect these stress-tolerant corals in marginal reefs. The equatorial coastline of Brazil is characterized by low intra-annual and inter-annual variations in SST, which suggests that the S. stellata corals here may be acclimatized to these stable conditions and, consequently, have a lower bleaching threshold because of lower historical heat stress.",UNIV FED CEARA,"SOARES, MD (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED CEARA, INST CIENCIAS MAR LABOMAR, AV ABOLICAO 3207, FORTALEZA, CEARA, BRAZIL",NA,

This extension includes some of the most desirable tourist destinations within the country. The local preference is directed to the model ""sun, sand and sea."" The Marau Peninsula represents one of the most important drivers of economic development in the region. The intensification of activities on the beaches of MarauÃÅ results in the increase of tourist flow, real estate development and the establishment of support infrastructure resulting in increasing pressure on local ecosystems. After assessing the degree of anthropogenic changes in this coastal extension, the northern portion stands out as the most impacted area. This includes the beaches of Taipus de Fora, and TreÃÇs Coqueiros e Ponta do MutaÃÅ. Recreational capacity assessment of these beaches indicates that Taipus de Fora holds more than 2,000 users in its peak time. This represents, respectively, over 6.5 and 12 times the number assessed for TreÃÇs Coqueiros e Ponta do MutaÃÅ beaches. However, it is important to point out that Taipus de Fora offers greater beach length and width, around twice the area (6.34 m2) to its users. During interviews conducted in the area, 80% of users reported feeling comfortable with a medium or low occupation of the beach. The survey also indicated that ‚Äúinfrastructure of goods and services‚Äù is an important variable in this occupation model. Around 42% of users surveyed consider the presence of support infrastructure an important decision variable. Only 16% of users responded that these facilities were not desirable. Results indicate that available recreational area and support infrastructure on the beach are important components for attracting tourists. Therefore, it is important to maintain current conditions of use (occupation density) in order to preserve the quality and recreational attractiveness. This will also help in the preservation of costal ecosystems, including coral reefs.",INST FED EDUCACAO CIENCIA AND TECNOL BAIANO,"DE SOUZA, JR (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), INST FED EDUCACAO CIENCIA \& TECNOL BAIANO, INST GEOSCI, CAMPUS URUGUCA,RUA DR JOAO NASCIMENTO S-N, BR-45680000 URUCUCA, BA, BRAZIL",COORDINATION FOR HIGHER LEVEL GRADUATES IMPROVEMENT (CAPES)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ),

THESE BEACHES SHARE VERY  SIMILAR GEOMORPHOLOGICAL AND HYDRODYNAMIC CONDITIONS BUT THE  SUBLITTORAL ZONE OF URCA BEACH IS MORE STRUCTURALLY-COMPLEX BECAUSE OF  THE PRESENCE OF ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURES MADE OF CONCRETE AND BEDS OF  SEAGRASS AND DRIFTING MACROALGAE IN CONTRAST TO THE MORE HOMOGENEOUS  SANDY SUBSTRATE FOUND IN DENTRO BEACH. A TOTAL OF 1257 FISH WERE CAUGHT  WITH H. CLUPEOLA N=640 A. BRASILIENSIS N=161 T CAROLINUS N=123  AND T. GOODEI N=91 ACCOUNTING FOR THE DOMINANT SPECIES.

Colonial ascidians consist, exclusively, of brooding species, with lecithotrophic larvae that have a limited dispersal. As a result, there is a marked differentiation among populations. In this work, we used allozyme electrophoresis to access the genetic variation in four populations of Symplegma rubra, a colonial ascidian frequently found in the intertidal zone of Southeastern Brazilian coast. High variability was found at three of the four sites sampled, the exception being Praia Grande in the State of Rio de Janeiro. At this site, there was a great preponderance of clones, which possibly reflected the enclosed nature of the location and its low water circulation that reduce the dispersal capabilities of these animals. S. rubra did not conform to expectations for random mating (Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium): there was a deficit of heterozygotes that was more related to the small population size than to inbreeding processes, since F is analysis per locus revealed a deficiency of heterozygotes at only one locus‚ÄîMDH*. The greatest variation in allele frequency was found for GPI-2*. Analyses of genetic variability revealed moderate differentiation among the populations (F ST=0.051), which was unexpected for a species with a low dispersal capability. Rafting, a frequently underestimated means of dispersal, may be the main mode of gene flow in this species over large areas, since colonies of S. rubra are frequently seen growing on drift material and there is no evidence that the larva survive for a long time in the plankton.",UNIV FED RURAL RIO DE JANEIRO,"DIAS, GM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED RURAL RIO DE JANEIRO, INST TRES RIOS, DEPT CIENCIAS ADM \& AMBIENTE, BR-25802180 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL",COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); FAEPEX/UNICAMP,

With an area of 1000 km2, warm and shallow waters, it offers optimum conditions for growth of well-developed coral reefs. Comparing our survey using a video-transect method with data acquired by J. Laborel (1969a), a significant change in the reef coral and octocoral abundance has occurred. Elevated water turbidity was already noted by Laborel, and may have increased in recent decades, due to urban development in the bay surroundings in the last 50 years. A multitude of complex changes in the surrounds of the bay also contributed for the reef decline, including the construction of an oil refinery (1950‚Äôs), a petrochemical complex (1978), a dam (built in 1985) and a cement plant (built in 1954), due to their chemical and muddy waste discharges into the bay.",NA,NA,NA,

EDWARDS A 1983,1983,Marine zoogeography of St Paul's Rocks,BIOGEOGRAPHY,"The zoogeographical relationships of the shallow water marine fauna of St Paul's Rocks (equatorial Atlantic) are examined with respect to ocean current patterns. Of seventy-seven benthic species considered, 46% are amphi-Atlantic, 14% occur at the central Atlantic islands of Ascension and/or St Helena as well as in either the eastern or western Atlantic, and 5% are endemic to the Rocks. Of the remaining twenty-seven species, 74% are shared only with the western Atlantic, 15% only with Ascension/St Helena, and 11% only with the eastern Atlantic. We deduce that the primary route of immigration for shallow water benthic species has been from Brazil, via the Atlantic Equatorial Undercurrent. Some input from Ascension Island and West Africa by means of the South Equatorial Current is also indicated. The zoogeographical composition of the St Paul's fauna is discussed in relation to current velccities and larval lifetimes. We conclude that St Paul's is essentially ail impoverished oceanic outpost of the Brazilian faunal province.",NA,NA,NA,
EDWARDS A 1983-a,1983,THE ECOLOGY OF SAINT PAUL'S ROCKS (EQUATORIAL ATLANTIC),,"St Paul‚Äôs Rocks are a remote group of islets, barely 400 m across, in the equatorial midAtlantic ( 0 3 5 ‚ÄòN 29‚Äô2 I ‚ÄôW). The results of a primarily zoological survey of the Rocks, carried out in September 1979 by the Cambridge Expedition to Saint Paul‚Äôs Rocks, are reported. In addition, earlier studies of the Rocks‚Äôbiology are discussed in the light of recent research. The terrestrial fauna is dominated by three species of sea-bird and a land crab. Also reported from on land are a few species of insects, ticks and spiders, an endemic pseudoscorpion, and a centipede; the majority of these species are associated with the seabirds. The islets are devoid of tracheophytes, bryophytes and lichens. The marine ecology of the Rocks is discussed with respect to habitat. Five habitats are distinguished in the supralittoral and littoral zones; the fauna and to a limited extent the flora of each is described. Sublittorally the Rocks consist almost entirely of steep escarpments extending to 60 m depth and beyond. The shallow sublittoral ( < 60 m deep) is divided into four habitats: ( I ) Palythoa zone; (2) Caulerpa zone; (3) sub-Caulerpa zone, and (4) areas of unstable substrates. The Pnlythoa zone occupies a band extending from the base of the littoral to a depth of c. 5 m and is dominated by a mat-forming hexacoral, Palythoa caribaeorum. Below this zone to a depth of c. 33 m the rock faces are thickly invested by a species of green-alga, Caulerpa racemosa. At depth this Caulerpa dominated zone is succeeded by an invertebrate dominated community. Unstable substrates are represented by a few pockets of coarse sand and some patches of rubble. The communities in each of these habitats are described. A primarily taxonomic review of the deep-water fauna is also included. Finally, the influence of ocean currents on the zoogeographical relationships of the Rocks‚Äô fauna is briefly examined.",NA,NA,NA,

ENDO CAK 2019 SCIENT REP,2019,Low connectivity compromises the conservation of reef fishes by marine protected areas in the tropical south Atlantic,,"the total spatial coverage of Marine protected Areas (MpA) within the Brazilian economic exclusive Zone (EEZ) has recently achieved the quantitative requirement of the Aichii Biodiversity Target 11. However, the distribution of MpA in the Brazilian eeZ is still unbalanced regarding the proportion of protected ecosystems, protection goals and management types. Moreover, the demographic connectivity between these MPA and their effectiveness regarding the maintenance of biodiversity are still not comprehensively understood. An individual-based modeling scheme coupled with a regional hydrodynamic model of the ocean is used to determine the demographic connectivity of reef fishes based on the widespread genus Sparisoma found in the oceanic islands and on the Brazilian continental shelf between 10¬∞ N and 23¬∞ S. Model results indicate that MPA are highly isolated due to extremely low demographic connectivity. Consequently, low connectivity and the long distances separating MPA contribute to their isolation. Therefore, the current MPA design falls short of its goal of maintaining the demographic connectivity of Sparisoma populations living within these areas. In an extreme scenario in which the MpA rely solely on protected populations for recruits, it is unlikely that they will be able to effectively contribute to the resilience of these populations or other reef fish species sharing the same dispersal abilities. Results also show that recruitment occurs elsewhere along the continental shelf indicating that the protection of areas larger than the current MpA would enhance the network, maintain connectivity and contribute to the conservation of reef fishes.",NA,NA,NA,

FEITOSA JLL & FERREIRA BP 2014 MAR ECOL,2014,Distribution and feeding patterns of juvenile parrotfish on algal-dominated coral reefs,Brazil; reef fish; Scaridae; Southwestern Atlantic; Sparisoma axillare ,"By the consumption of algae, parrotfishes open space for young coral settlement and growth, thus playing a central role on the maintenance of coral reefs. However, juvenile parrotfish ecology is often overlooked due to the difficulty discerning species during this phase. Herein, we present the first attempt to investigate changes in habitat use and diet that happen to juveniles of the Redeye parrotfish Sparisoma axillare, focusing on four zones within an algal-dominated reef: the macroalgal beds, back reef, reef flat, and fore reef. Smaller S. axillare juveniles (<5 cm) preferred to inhabit the macroalgal beds and the reef flat, whereas juveniles larger than 5 cm were more abundant in the back and fore reefs due to distinct post-settlement habitat conditions. Aggressive interactions with the territorial damselfish Stegastes fuscus were the primary driving factor of juvenile distribution and feeding rates. Attack rates increased with juvenile size and the lowest bite rates were observed in zones with higher densities of territorial damselfish. In previous studies, the persistence of parrotfish recruits in habitats dominated by damselfish was reduced, but newly settled parrotfish occurred more densely within the damselfish domain by behaving as a cryptic reef fish. As these juveniles grew, their bite rates increased, a change associated with a shift from cryptic to roving behavior. Feeding preferences were determined by substrate cover, where juveniles fed on available food sources in each habitat. Juveniles relied on jointed calcareous algae in habitats dominated by these algae, a pattern not observed for thick leathery algae. Filamentous algae were the preferred food for smaller fish; for individuals greater than 10 cm, a higher ingestion of sand was observed. Most studies evaluating the functional role of parrotfish do not consider species feeding preferences. However, the potential for a species to turn an impacted reef back to a coral-dominated phase is influenced by their food selection, which is dependent on the algal species composition.",UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO,"FEITOSA, JLL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO, DEPT OCEANOG, UFPE, CTR TECNOL \& GEOCIENCIAS, AV ARQUITETURA S-N CIDADE UNIV, BR-50670901 RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL",CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES),

Seventy-five fish species (25 new records) were recorded, of which 58 are reef inhabitants and 17 are pelagic. The most speciose families were Muraenidae (seven species), Carangidae (five), Pomacentridae (five), Labridae (four), Serranidae (three), and Scaridae (three).¬†Stegaster sanctipauli¬†(Pomacentrdae),¬†Chromis multilineata¬†(Pomacentridae),¬†Melichthys niger¬†(Balistidae) and¬†Caranx lugubris¬†(Caranagidae) were the most visually abundant fishes. Depsite being recorded in prior surveys,¬†Carcharhinus galapagensis¬†and¬†Anthias salmopunctatus¬†were not observed by our team. It was observed that 60.3% of the reef fish species are carnivores, 15.5% planktivores, 8.6% omnivores, 8.6% territorial herbivores, and 6.9% non-territorial herbivores. Of the 58 reef fishes recorded, four are endemic to St. Paul‚Äôs Rocks and about 80% also occur off the coast of Brazil. It is thought therefore that St. Paul‚Äôs Rocks should be regarded as an impoverished outost of the Brazilian province",NA,NA,NA,

The present study represents the first SCUBA based survey of the deep reef fishes off the Brazilian coast between 35 and 70 m. A species list was compiled based on visual observations, collections, video recording, and fishes obtained from commercial fishing boats. A total of 158 fish species belonging to 49 families was recorded. Thirty-two species were formally recorded for the first time from the study area, four of which [Apogon robbyi Gilbert, 1997; Coryphopterus eidolon BoÃàhlke & Robins, 1960; Psilotris batrachodes BoÃàhlke, 1963; and Xanthichthys ringens (Linnaeus, 1758)] represent new records for the western South Atlantic. Fifty-seven species had their depth range extended to depths > 40 m. The most species rich families were Carangidae (14 species), Gobiidae (12), Lutjanidae (11), Labridae (11), Serranidae (10), Haemulidae (8), and Scaridae (7).

This study analyses Brazilian MOF legislation as a tool for conservation. Brazil's legal framework includes participation in international agreements, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), as well as administrative measures that regulate the capture of certain species in Brazil. However, compared with the laws that pertain to terrestrial fauna, Brazil's MOF legislation remains limited and possibly lacks the necessary technical and scientific foundation. There is a trend to prohibit the capture of organisms according to the criterion of ‚Äúrarity‚Äù. The legislation also includes the use of ‚Äúpositive lists‚Äù, which identify which species may be caught and establish maximum individual capture and trade quotas. Nevertheless, the criteria used to determine the quotas are not established a priori and apparently defined without scientific rigour. In this context, it is impossible to affirm that Brazilian MOF legislation fulfils its function as an instrument for the conservation of MOF stocks.",FDF (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),"SAMPAIO, FDF (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MARECHAL MALLET STR 400-12, BR-80540230 CURITIBA, PARANA, BRAZIL",NA,

In 2002, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment funded a pilot project to assess the status of conservation of Brazilian reefs using the global methods of Reef Check. Six representative regions of Brazilian reefs, between latitudes 3¬∞ and 18¬∞S, were chosen for the assessment, including four coastal areas, one oceanic island and one atoll. The selected reefs were located inside the boundaries of marine protected areas of the two main types established in Brazil: fully protected and sustainable use, where extraction is allowed. Intensity of use in this last category was variable, largely depending on local conditions such as human population densities and management regimes. From March 2002 to April 2003, Reef Check surveys were conducted in several sites within this regions. A geographic information system was built using LANDSAT imagery. Reef Check methods were adapted to fit local requirements while permitting collection of the same basic data. Hard coral cover varied between 5 to 35%. Higher cover was found at Abrolhos reefs. Specific hard coral composition varied between regions, with lower diversity of corals registered at northern reefs. Indicator species of fish, including Lutjanids, Scarids, Serranids and ornamental species were significantly less abundant in areas were fishing and collecting were allowed. The same pattern was observed for commercially exploited species of lobster and octopus. Larger species of groupers were generally absent of all areas with very few exceptions. In the summer of 2003 a synchronized bleaching event was recorded. This is the first large scale event registered and shows the importance of large scale monitoring in Brazil",NA,NA,NA,

Semi-structured interviews and tests were made with fishermen selected under the criteria of ""specialists"". The data analysis followed the union model of the different individual competences. Grouping analysis was performed on data referring to the localities of the occurrence of these fish, depth, coloration, and morphological characteristics of the species using the Pearson correlation coefficient (UPGMA). A total of 19 species were named within the snapper group, although three of them could not be scientifically identified. The Lutjanidae family presented the greatest numbers of species (n = 9). Other families mentioned were: the Serranidae (n = 3), Holocentridae (n = 2), Priacanthidae (n = 1), Mullidae (n = 1). The 1:1 correspondence between fishermen's local names and scientific species observed in this study indicates the richness of local fishermen knowledge. Analysis of the LEK related to the feeding habits of these fish and indicated that most were considered as being carnivorous, which agrees with the specialized literature consulted. In terms of their spatial distribution, two categories were detected: locality of occurrence (rivers/sea, coast, and offshore) and depth (surface, mid-depth, mid-depth/deep, deep). The fish were considered locally to be ""winter fish"", based on harvested yields. Most of the interviewees knew little about the reproductive aspects of these fish. The main criteria used to identify, name, and classify the species were based on color and morphological aspects. Much of the information gathered in this study agreed with the published literature, which strengthens the importance of including LEK in planning and decision-making processes.",MAMIRAUA INST SUSTAINABLE DEV,"CALO, CFF (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MAMIRAUA INST SUSTAINABLE DEV, ORNAMENTAL FISH PROJECT, BR-69470000 TEFE, AM, BRAZIL",FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DA BAHIA; UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE SANTA CRUZ; ``UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE FEIRA DE SANTANA'' - LABORATORY OF ICHTHYOLOGY,

LOCATION SIX BRAZILIAN TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL CORAL AND ROCKY COASTAL  REEFS AND THE OCEANIC ISLAND OF ATOL DAS ROCAS BETWEEN LATITUDES  0DEGREES AND 27DEGREES S.  METHODS UNDERWATER VISUAL CENSUS DATA COLLECTED BY THE AUTHORS FIVE  LOCATIONS OR OBTAINED FROM THE LITERATURE TWO LOCATIONS WERE USED TO  ESTIMATE THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF 123 FISH SPECIES BELONGING TO 33  REEF-ASSOCIATED FAMILIES. CRYPTIC SPECIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE  ANALYSIS. FISHES WERE GROUPED IN EIGHT TROPHIC CATEGORIES ROVING  HERBIVORES TERRITORIAL HERBIVORES MOBILE INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS SESSILE  INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS OMNIVORES PLANKTIVORES PISCIVORES AND  CARNIVORES. AFTER A SERIES OF DETAILED PREDICTIONS BASED ON PHYLOGENY  PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS AND ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS WAS ESTABLISHED THE  COMMUNITY TROPHIC STRUCTURE WAS ANALYSED ALONG A LATITUDINAL GRADIENT  AND AMONG COASTAL MID-SHORE AND OCEANIC SITES.  RESULTS THE TROPHIC STRUCTURE OF BRAZILIAN REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES CLEARLY  CHANGED WITH LATITUDE. ROVING HERBIVORES SUCH AS SCARIDS AND ACANTHURIDS  WERE PROPORTIONALLY MORE ABUNDANT AT LOW LATITUDES. THE BROWSING  HERBIVORES KYPHOSIDS FOLLOWED AN OPPOSITE LATITUDINAL PATTERN. THE  PARROTFISH GENUS SPARISOMA MORE PLASTIC IN ITS FEEDING HABITS THAN  SCARUS PRESENTED WIDER DISTRIBUTION. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF  TERRITORIAL HERBIVORES DID NOT DECREASE TOWARDS HIGHER LATITUDES. MOBILE  INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN LOW LATITUDES OR THE  SECOND MOST IMPORTANT TROPHIC GUILD IN HIGH LATITUDES AT ALL COASTAL  SITES.

OMNIVORES DOMINATED HIGH LATITUDE REEFS 27DEGREES S AND PLANKTIVORES  THE OCEANIC ISLAND ATOL DAS ROCAS. PISCIVORES AND CARNIVORES WERE  PROPORTIONALLY BETTER REPRESENTED IN HIGH LATITUDES.  MAIN CONCLUSIONS LATITUDINAL PATTERNS SEEM TO BE INFLUENCED BY  PHYLOGENY PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS MAINLY RELATED TO TEMPERATURE  AND ALSO BY ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS. GRAZING SCARIDS AND ACANTHURIDS ARE  LARGELY RESTRICTED TO TROPICAL REEFS AND SHOW AN ABRUPT DECLINE BEYOND  23DEGREES S. THIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE AMOUNT OF ALGAE PRESENT BUT  PROBABLY TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS.

One of these species is Epinephelus itajara, which can exceed 2 m in length and 400 kg weight, is classified by the IUCN as a critically endangered. In Brazil, there is currently a moratorium that prohibits the capture of this specie, and in the northeastern coast, a Marine Protected Area was recently established properly justified by the existence a one spawning aggregation. The scope of the present study was the analysis the LEK of fishers with the goal of contributing to the conservation of E. Itajara. The Knowledge of 24 ‚Äúexperts‚Äù was recorded through semi-structured interviews with fishermen selected based on their expertise. LEK regarding some aspects of the life history of E. itajara, such as its morphology, spatial distribution, feeding, breeding and conservation, was systematized. The interviews were conducted in synchronic and diachronic situations. The data analysis followed the model of unity of the various individual skills, while the consistency of the analysis was tested using a matrix of methods employed in comparative cognitive science. Potential reproductive aggregation sites were identified by experts through projective interviews conducted based on a cartographic database and transferred to a geographic information system (GIS). The LEK of these specialists in relation to the biological and ecological characteristics of E. itajara showed a high level of detail and a high agreement with the scientific literature. Projective interviews are presented as a promising tool allowing spatialization of the information generated through the registration of LEK. Therefore, the visualization of information from the fishermen, as well as its analysis and comparison with other databases, is simplified, thereby contributing to the decision-making process concerning the conservation of marine ecosystem in Brazil. Integration of LEK with scientific knowledge is an efficient strategy for the conservation of endangered species, as it provides important additional biological information that can be used in the process of participative and sustainable management of marine resources.",UNIV ESTADUAL SANTA CRUZ,"FERREIRA, HM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADUAL SANTA CRUZ, PROGRAMA POSGRAD ZOOL, RODOVIA ILHEUS ITABUNA KM16, ILHEUS, BA, BRAZIL",BRAZILIAN NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT - CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); FUNDACAO O BOTICARIO DE PROTECAO A NATUREZA,

Maximum‚Äêparsimony and distance analyses were employed to investigate biogeographical relationships among those areas. A collection of 26 phylogenies of various Atlantic reef fish taxa was used to assess patterns of origin and diversification relative to evolutionary scenarios based on spatio‚Äêtemporal sequences of species splitting produced by geological and palaeoceanographic events. We present data on faunal (species and genera) richness, endemism patterns, diversity buildup (i.e. speciation processes), and evaluate the operation of the main biogeographical barriers and/or filters. Phylogenetic (proportion of sister species) and distributional (number of shared species) patterns are generally concordant with recognized biogeographical provinces in the Atlantic. The highly uneven distribution of species in certain genera appears to be related to their origin, with highest species richness in areas with the greatest phylogenetic depth. Diversity buildup in Atlantic reef fishes involved (1) diversification within each province, (2) isolation as a result of biogeographical barriers, and (3) stochastic accretion by means of dispersal between provinces. The timing of divergence events is not concordant among taxonomic groups. The three soft (non‚Äêterrestrial) inter‚Äêregional barriers (mid‚ÄêAtlantic, Amazon, and Benguela) clearly act as ‚Äòfilters‚Äô by restricting dispersal but at the same time allowing occasional crossings that apparently lead to the establishment of new populations and species. Fluctuations in the effectiveness of the filters, combined with ecological differences among provinces, apparently provide a mechanism for much of the recent diversification of reef fishes in the Atlantic. Our data set indicates that both historical events (e.g. Tethys closure) and relatively recent dispersal (with or without further speciation) have had a strong influence on Atlantic tropical marine biodiversity and have contributed to the biogeographical patterns we observe today; however, examples of the latter process outnumber those of the former.",UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,"FLOETER, SR (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, NATL CTR ECOL ANAL \& SYNTH, 735 STATE ST,SUITE 300, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93101 USA",NA,

CA and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activities increased up to 8 days of exposure, but recovered back after 12 days of experiment. Short-term exposure to increasing temperature or long-term exposure to the combination of stressors reduced LPO, suggesting the occurrence of a remodeling process in the lipid composition of biological membranes.

The ecological relevance of parameters measured at biochemical or cellular level is now considered an extremely important feature in environmental studies, and can be used as early warning signs of environmental degradation. In this context, the effects of acute exposure (9‚ÄØh) to Cu were assessed on the maximum photochemical efficiency of zooxanthellae (Fv/Fm) and on the activity of key enzymes [carbonic anhydrase (CA) and Ca-ATPase] involved in coral physiology using the scleractinian coral Mussismilia harttii as a biological model. Corals were exposed to different concentrations of dissolved Cu (4.6‚Äì19.4‚ÄØŒºg/L) using two different experimental approaches: a laboratory closed system and a marine mesocosm system. Fv/Fm values and Ca - ATPase activity were not affect by exposure to Cu in any of the exposure systems. However, a significant reduction in CA activity was observed in corals exposed to 11.9 and 19.4‚ÄØŒºg Cu/L in the laboratory and at all concentrations of Cu tested in the mesocosm system (4.6, 6.0 and 8.5‚ÄØŒºg/L).

Sampling sites were distributed between sides of the island facing the continent (North) and ocean (South) across two depth-dependent substrates. As proved by ordination and permutation analyses, these two factors accounted for nearly half the variation observed among assemblages, either with species abundance or coverage area data. Out of 46 OTUs surveyed (~‚Äâ3000 individuals), Tedania (Tedania) ignis, Scopalina ruetzleri, and Iotrochota arenosa dominated the community, even though most of the dissimilarity detected among assemblages relied on 20% of the OTUs. The northern side was proved as more diverse, and the south-facing side held more unspecific, putatively new OTUs. Assemblages dwelling on rocky-to-sandy interface bottoms were meager in species number, although they mainly included Dragmacidon reticulatum and the endemic Brazilian sponge Polymastia janeirensis.

TUBES  GRAINS ARE GLUED TOGETHER WITH BIOMINERALIZED CEMENT SECRETED FROM A  BUILDING ORGAN CONNECTED TO SPECIALIZED GLANDS. DIFFERENT METHODS OF  MICRO-ANALYSIS WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE BIOMINERAL COMPONENTS OF THESE  CEMENTS FOR FOUR VARYINGLY GREGARIOUS TUBE-BUILDING POLYCHAETES LANICE  CONCHILEGA PECTINARIA KORENI SABELLARIA ALVEOLATA AND PHRAGMATOPOMA  CANDATA. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DESCRIBE AND COMPARE THE INTER- AND  THE INTRASPECIFIC VARIABILITY IN THE MAIN BIOMINERAL COMPONENTS OF  CEMENT AT LOCAL REGIONAL AND CONTINENTAL SCALES. SCANNING ELECTRON  MICROSCOPY CONFIRMS AN IDENTICAL STRUCTURE OF THE CEMENT WITHIN SPECIES  OF SABELLARIIDAE IN EUROPE AND AMERICA. ELECTRON PROBE MICRO-ANALYSIS  EPMA CONFIRMS THE PRESENCE OF CALCIUM PHOSPHORUS AND MAGNESIUM PLUS  TRACES OF MANGANESE IN ALL CEMENTS WITH VARYING CONCENTRATIONS OF THESE  ELEMENTS AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR THE SAME SPECIES OR FOR DIFFERENT  SPECIES AT THE SAME LOCATION.

IMPORTANT TO SUCH  EFFORTS HAS BEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL SKELETON-BASED CRITERIA TO  DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO MAJOR ECOLOGICAL GROUPS OF SCLERACTINIANS  ZOOXANTHELLATES WHICH LIVE IN SYMBIOSIS WITH DINOFLAGELLATE ALGAE AND  AZOOXANTHELLATES WHICH LACK ENDOSYMBIOTIC DINOFLAGELLATES. EXISTING  CRITERIA ARE BASED ON OVERALL SKELETAL MORPHOLOGY AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL  INDICATORS NONE OF THEM BEING PARTICULARLY ROBUST. HERE WE EXPLORE  ANOTHER SKELETAL FEATURE NAMELY FINE-SCALE GROWTH BANDING WHICH  DIFFERS BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS OF CORALS. USING VARIOUS  ULTRA-STRUCTURAL IMAGING TECHNIQUES E.G. TEM SEM AND NANOSIMS WE  HAVE CHARACTERIZED SKELETAL GROWTH INCREMENTS COMPOSED OF DOUBLETS OF  OPTICALLY LIGHT AND DARK BANDS IN A BROAD SELECTION OF EXTANT SYMBIOTIC  AND ASYMBIOTIC CORALS. SKELETONS OF ZOOXANTHELLATE CORALS ARE  CHARACTERIZED BY REGULAR GROWTH BANDING WHEREAS IN SKELETONS OF  AZOOXANTHELLATE CORALS THE GROWTH BANDING IS IRREGULAR. IMPORTANTLY THE  REGULARITY OF GROWTH BANDS CAN BE EASILY QUANTIFIED WITH A COEFFICIENT  OF VARIATION OBTAINED BY MEASURING BANDWIDTHS ON SEM IMAGES OF POLISHED  AND ETCHED SKELETAL SURFACES OF SEPTA AND/OR WALLS. WE FIND THAT THIS  COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION LOWER VALUES INDICATE HIGHER REGULARITY  RANGES FROM SIMILAR TO 40 TO SIMILAR TO 90\% IN AZOOXANTHELLATE CORALS  AND FROM SIMILAR TO 5 TO SIMILAR TO 15\% IN SYMBIOTIC SPECIES. WITH MORE  THAN 90\% 28 OUT OF 31 OF THE STUDIED CORALS CONFORMING TO THIS  MICROSTRUCTURAL CRITERION IT REPRESENTS AN EASY AND ROBUST METHOD TO  DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN ZOOXANTHELLATE AND AZOOXANTHELLATE CORALS.

Above 50 mm, the proportion of red males increased in the population, indicating that functional maturity is also related to colour pattern.

IT  AFFECTS LIGHT AVAILABILITY AND WILL ACT TOGETHER WITH GLOBAL SEA LEVEL  RISE TO REDUCE POTENTIAL PHOTOSYNTHESIS THAT IS IMPORTANT TO  LIGHT-ENHANCED CALCIFICATION IN CORALS. CORALS ARE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS  TO THE MORPHOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY OF REEFS THROUGH SKELETAL CALCIFICATION.  BIOCONSTRUCTION BY CORALS IS A MULTIFACTORIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONTROLLED  BY PHYSICAL E.G. IRRADIANCE AND TURBIDITY AND BIOLOGICAL FACTORS SUCH  AS PHOTOACCLIMATION PROCESS. IN THIS PAPER WE INTEND TO SHOW HOW  TURBIDITY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY MIGHT INTERPLAY TO PRODUCE A CORAL SPECIES  DISTRIBUTION THAT CONTROLS REEF GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY. THE  ABROLHOS COMPLEX IS COMPOSED BY A GROUP OF REEFS CLOSER TO THE COASTLINE  CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LIGHT ATTENUATION VALUE KD490 = 0.11 AND  ANOTHER ONE ABOUT 60 KM FAR FROM THE COAST CHARACTERIZED BY A LIGHT  ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT OF KD490 = 0.08.

CORAL SPECIES COVER AND DISTRIBUTION DATA WERE  USED TO ESTIMATE REEF BIOCONSTRUCTION [SENSU DONE 1995] RATES. A field experiment examined the metabolic function of five species (Mussismilia braziliensis, Mussismilia hispida, Mussismilia harttii, Montastraea cavernosa and Siderastrea stellata) through respirometry and rapid light curves (RLC). Bioconstruction potential and primary gross productivity demonstrated a substantial variability between reefs and species. In combination, these functional responses meant that coral species distribution is controlled by local factors and acclimation process. Therefore, our results suggest that these functional responses are useful tools to understand photoacclimation process and its consequences, species distribution and the space occupation on Abrolhos bank. We highlight the deleterious effect of turbidity in bioconstruction. This suggests that the local processes that increase sediment runoff is an immediate impact and must be controlled.",NA,NA,NA,

This zone has an important ecological role, due to its mangroves and its location next to Abrolhos coral reef, the most important in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating methods, accompanied by a sedimentological study, were applied to sediment cores in order to establish sedimentation rates and identify historical trends of land use and erosive processes. Sedimentation rates were established according to the ``Constant Rate of Supply{''} (CRS) Pb-210 dating model, which was preferred rather than the ``Constant Initial Concentration{''} (CIC) model. Corrected sedimentation rates obtained from Pb-210 dating were corroborated through a second independent radionuclide tracer such as Cs-137. The sedimentation rates obtained according to the CRS model for the cores were 1.07 +/- 0.13 cm yr(-1) for T\#2 (inner sector), 0.65 +/- 0.06 cm yr(-1) for T\#5 and 0.85 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) for T\#8 (outer sector). The difference in sedimentation rates among the sampling sites could be due to hydrodynamic processes and could be related to the tendency of increase of erosive processes, conditioned by the changes in the landscape and land use to, which this region has been submitted.",UNIV SAO PAULO,"ANGELI, JLF (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SAO PAULO, OCEANOG INST, BR-05508120 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP)FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP) [2013/00102-8]; CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [870135/2011-2],

THESE ARE TAKEN FROM BLOCKS  EXCAVATED ACROSS A REEF-FRONT/ REEF-CREST/ REEF-FLAT SECTION IN THE  WINDWARD TRANSECT AND A REEF-CREST / REEF-FLAT SECTION IN THE LEEWARD  TRANSECT. THE MAIN SUBSTRATE AVAILABLE FOR ENCRUSTATION IS THE DOMINANT  PRIMARY FRAMEWORKING-BUILDING CORALLINE ALGA POROLITHON CF PACHYDERMUM.  THE DIVERSITY NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OF COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG  ENCRUSTERS INCREASE FROM REEF-FRONT AND REEF-CREST TO REEF-FLAT IN BOTH  TRANSECTS. VERMETID GASTROPODS AND HOMOTREMATID AND ACERVULINID  FORAMINIFERANS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SECONDARY FRAMEWORK BUILDERS IN  THE SURVEYED REEFS. THE PROPOSED SUCCESSIONAL MODELS PRESENT AN ACCOUNT  OF THE OPERATION OF COMPETITIVE PROCESSES OVER TIME AND SPACE PROVIDING  FURTHER EVIDENCE OF A NON-HIERARCHICAL PATTERN OF COMPETITION FOR SPACE.  CHANGES IN REEF-FRAMEWORK SUCCESSION ALONG THE REEF TRANSECTS ARE  CONTROLLED BY EXTRINSIC FACTORS.

INCORPORATING THE VIEW OF MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS IS AN  IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF MPA PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT AS IT MAY  SIMULTANEOUSLY HELP REDUCE CONFLICTS AND INCREASE ADHERENCE TO RULES AND  COMPLIANCE. HOWEVER THE MOST ASSESSMENTS OF MPA MANAGEMENT  EFFECTIVENESS IS UNDERTAKEN SOLELY BASED ON MANAGERS' PERCEPTIONS. HERE  WE COMPARED THE PERCEPTIONS OF MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS AMONG MANAGERS  AND THE MANAGEMENT COUNCIL MEMBERS OF THREE BRAZILIAN MARINE RESERVES.  COUNCIL MEMBERS INCLUDE STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS  WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. OVERALL THE MARINE RESERVES WERE CLASSIFIED  AS HAVING MEDIUM MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS WITH MANAGERS PERCEIVING  HIGHER LEVELS OF EFFECTIVENESS THAN THE COUNCIL MEMBERS. THE MAIN  DIFFERENCES WERE RELATED TO POOR COMMUNICATION AMONG MANAGERS AND  COUNCIL MEMBERS AND THE PERCEPTION OF LACK OF PARTICIPATION ON  MANAGEMENT DECISIONS BY COUNCIL MEMBERS. ASSESSING DIFFERENT  PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS GIVES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE  UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MANAGERS AND  STAKEHOLDERS IS ESSENTIAL TO GUARANTEE THAT MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES ARE  MORE EQUALLY RECOGNIZED. WE RECOMMEND THAT FURTHER EVALUATIONS CONSIDER  THE DIVERSITY OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THE MANAGEMENT TO GET A MORE  REALISTIC ASSESSMENT ON MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS.

In the central western Atlantic it supports commercially important fisheries in three geographically separate areas: the eastern Caribbean islands; the southern Netherlands Antilles; and northeast Brazil, although the resource remains unmanaged in all three areas and the stock structure unresolved. Previous tagging studies of H. affinis, in the central western Atlantic indicated very little about the movements of flyingfish off northeastern Brazil, but did show that flyingfish move freely between the eastern Caribbean islands, although they do not appear to travel as far as the southern Netherlands Antilles. However, tagging studies only address geographical movement of fish and cannot discriminate among genetically discrete stocks. In this study, we use mtDNA markers (restriction fragment length polymorphisms [RFLPs] of the D-loop region) to examine the genetic variation and its implication for the stock structure of flyingfish across the central western Atlantic. A total of 360 flyingfish were sampled from the commercial fisheries in the three geographical areas between January and August 1995. Sixty fish were taken from each of the two spawning populations in Barbados and 60 from the spawning populations in each of Dominica and Tobago (in the eastern Caribbean); 60 from Cura√ßao (in the southern Netherlands Antilles); and 60 from Cai√ßara (in Rio Grande do Norte, northeast Brazil). The mtDNA D-loop region was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and digested to produce RFLPs using five restriction enzymes. Extensive genetic diversity was observed, with distinct composite mitotypes being detected for each of the three geographical areas, indicating a lack of gene flow between these areas and the existence of at least three unit stocks of H. affinis in the central western Atlantic. The results of cluster analyses of composite mitotype sequence divergence and population sequence divergence, and parsimony analysis of composite mitotypes were entirely consistent with a 3-stock model. Furthermore, genetic heterogeneity was detected among eastern Caribbean populations indicating restricted gene flow even within a sub-region and emphasizing the need for more detailed studies of flyingfish spawning behaviour. These results contrast with the typically low levels of genetic variation reported for oceanic pelagic species, and for other marine species (reef fish, spiny lobster, queen conch) in the Caribbean and indicate that major ocean current patterns are not good predictors of gene flow for all species. The implications for management of the flyingfish resource in the central western Atlantic are that three independent stock assessments and management strategies would be appropriate; and that management of the eastern Caribbean stock will need to be at a regional level since the stock is shared between the different island states, while management of the southern Netherlands Antilles stock and the northeast Brazil stock could be at a national level.",UNIV W INDIES,"GOMES, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV W INDIES, MARINE RESOURCE \& ENVIRONM MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, CAVE HILL, BARBADOS",NA,

This study aims to recognize and interrogate, on the Rio Grande do Norte (RN, NE Brazil) outer shelves, specific seabed morphologies that could have been produced by the punctuated relative sea level rise of the last deglaciation. These sea floor morphologies, imaged by single-beam bathymetric data from two areas of the North and East outer Shelves, similar to 160 km apart, reveal terraces, submerged paleo-shorelines, reefs, and incised valleys, which act as regional archives of past sea levels. The North and East outer shelves, covered by carbonate sediments, display steep gradients (similar to 0.5 degrees), variable widths (up to 13 km), and are bound between a well-defined shelf break at 75 m water depth and a beachrock ridge at 25 m. A steep step on the sea floor occurs between depths of 60 and 70 m in both areas. Though interrupted by the Acu Incised Valley, two distinct continuous terraces, 3 and 4 km in width, at depths of 49 m (+/- 5 m) (T1n) and 33 m (+/- 3 m) (T2n), respectively, extend for 60 km along the North Shelf. Three nearly continuous terraces occur along the East Shelf on either the north or south sides of the Natal Canyon. A first, 6 km wide, lower terrace occurs at a depth of 54 m (+/- 4 m) (T1e). A second terrace, 2 km wide, at 40 m (+/- 2 m) (T2e), and a third 2 km wide upper terrace at 30 m (+/- 2 m) (T3e) are also found. Patch reefs scattered over the terraces rise in average to 3 m in height. Based upon their depth occurrences, the established limited neotectonics in the study areas, and correlations with well-established archives from other morphological features of similar outer shelves, we hypothesize that these reefs and terraces were likely formed during the last deglacial interval spanning from the end of the MWP-1A (70-60 m), through the MWP-1B (50-40 m), and to subsequent punctuated millennial sea level rise events (30-25 m) occurring prior to the 8.2 kyr cooling event",FED UNIV RIO GRANDE DONORTE UFRN,"GOMES, MP (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), FED UNIV RIO GRANDE DONORTE UFRN, POSTGRAD PROGRAM GEODYNAM \& GEOPHYS PPGG, LAB MARINE GEOL \& GEOPHYS \& ENVIRONM MONITORING G, NATAL, RN, BRAZIL","PETROBRASFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO AMAPA (FAPEAP)PETROBRAS [LABGEOMAR 882004/FUNPEC]; CNPQ - BRAZILIAN NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCILCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [PQ 303481/2009-9, 311413/2016-1, UNIVERSAL 486451/2012-7]; CAPES -BRAZILIAN FEDERAL AGENCY FOR SUPPORT AND EVALUATION OF GRADUATE EDUCATIONCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES) [IODP 88887.123925/2015-00]",

Because their CaCO3 production, rhodolith beds constitute areas of interest for mining activities. On the other hand, other goods and services provided by these environments such as nurseries habitats, fishing and climate regulation remain undersized. Besides directly CaCO3 exploitation, these diverse ecosystems within the Brazilian economic exclusive zone are often covering potentially sites for oil and gas extraction. The IBAMA (Environmental Agency of the Brazilian government) have been applying the precautionary principle to deny requests for oil/gas drilling activities where rhodolith beds occur. Here, we discuss recent data about diversity associated with rhodoliths and also record the ‚Äúrare‚Äù worm Nuchalosyllis cf. maiteae. More than the distribution of one only species, our finding is an emblematic example of our infancy knowledge state about diversity associated with rhodolith beds in southwestern Atlantic. We argue that these knowledge is still insufficient to subside any attempt in classify priorities areas for oil wells drilling. In addition, we claim that the precautionary principle adopted by IBAMA must prevalence until we have robust data allowing predictions concerning higher or lower biodiversity associated with rhodolith beds.",UNIV FED SAO PAULO,"PEREIRA, GH (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED SAO PAULO, LAB MARINE ECOL \& CONSERVAT, INST MAR, SANTOS, SP, BRAZIL",NA,

Among these species, sea urchins seem to play an ecological role that goes beyond the dynamics of coral-algal interaction on reef ecosystems. In this paper, we describe the commensal behavior of juveniles of two non-cryptobenthic reef fishes (Haemulon parra and Abudefduf saxatilis) with the sea urchin Diadema antillarum on sandstone reefs in Northeastern Brazil. Behavioral observations in situ raise the assumption thatD. antillarum may provide an alternative source of shelter and therefore influence microhabitat complexity, particularly, for juvenile reef fishes",UNIV SAO PAULO,"GRANDE, H (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SAO PAULO, DEPT OCEANOG BIOL, INST OCEANOG, PRACA OCEANOG 191, BR-05548120 SAO PAULO, SP, BRAZIL",CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [133768/2010-4],

THE EQUATORIAL SOURCES ARE MADE UP OF IN PART SOUTH ATLANTIC WATER  MOVING NORTHWARD AND COMPENSATING FOR SOUTHWARD FLOW AT DEPTH RELATED TO  MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION. SUBTROPICAL SURFACE WATER CONTAINS  RELATIVELY HIGH AMOUNTS OF RADIOCARBON C-14 WHEREAS EQUATORIAL WATERS  ARE INFLUENCED BY THE UPWELLING OF LOW C-14 WATER AND HAVE RELATIVELY  LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF C-14. WE USE A 250 YEAR RECORD OF DELTA C-14 IN A  CORAL FROM SOUTHWESTERN PUERTO RICO ALONG WITH PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED  CORAL DELTA C-14 RECORDS AS TRACERS OF SUBTROPICAL AND EQUATORIAL WATER  MIXING IN THE NORTHERN CARIBBEAN. DATA GENERATED IN THIS STUDY AND FROM  OTHER STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE INFLUENCE OF EITHER OF THE TWO WATER  MASSES CAN CHANGE CONSIDERABLY ON INTERANNUAL TO INTERDECADAL TIME  SCALES.

The total catch comprised tunas (30%), sharks (54%), billfishes (12%), and other fish species (4%). Fishing strategy and annual composition of catches showed large spatial and temporal variabilities with the dominant catches alternating among yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares; gray sharks, Carcharhinus spp.; and blue shark, Prionace glauca. Catches of blue and gray sharks showed a significant interaction among seamounts, with gray sharks occurring in maximum abundance around those seamounts that had relatively deep summits and lowsloping depth profiles.

NEVERTHELESS A  NUMBER OF RECORDS HOLD UP TO CRITICAL EVALUATION. EARLY ATTEMPTS TO  RECONSTRUCT THE LGM TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION CONDITIONS FOR THE  LGM AROUND 21 C-14 KA BP HAVE SUGGESTED THAT RELATIVE TO PRESENT  LOWLAND TEMPERATURES WERE ON AVERAGE ONLY A FEW DEGREES C COOLER  WHEREAS IN THE ANDES THE TEMPERATURE DEPRESSION WAS IN THE RANGE OF 6-8  DEGREES C. THESE RECONSTRUCTIONS FURTHER SUGGESTED THAT TROPICAL  PRECIPITATION WAS MORE LIMITED IN BOTH THE LOWLANDS AND IN THE ANDES.  ALTHOUGH RECENT POLLEN EVIDENCE SUPPORTS SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER TROPICAL  LOWLAND TEMPERATURES DURING THE LGM ADDITIONAL ALKENONE EVIDENCE FROM  SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND MODEL ANALYSIS ARE CONTRADICTORY.

BASED ON GLACIAL  PERIGLACIAL AND POLLEN EVIDENCE A LGM TEMPERATURE DEPRESSION OF 5-6  DEGREES C CAN BE ASSUMED FOR BOTH TROPICAL LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA AND THE  ANDES. THESE LGM VALUES FOR THE COOLING CORRESPOND WITH RECENT CORAL  RECORDS FROM BARBADOS AND THE SOUTHWESTERN PACIFIC ICE-CORE RECORDS  FROM PERU NOBLE-GAS MEASUREMENTS IN BRAZIL AND OCEAN CORE RECORDS FROM  THE WESTERN EQUATORIAL ATLANTIC.

Clepticus africanus, n. sp., is described from fourteen specimens collected from S√£o Tom√© Island in the Gulf of Guinea off the equatorial African coast. Clepticus brasiliensis, n. sp., is described from nine-teen specimens (plus additional material) collected from the coast and offshore islands of Brazil south of the Amazon. Neither species is significantly different in morphometric or meristic characters from the heretofore sole member of the genus, the tropical western North Atlantic Clepticus parrae. Both new specis are distinguished from C. parrae. Both new species are distinguished from C. parrae by coloration and by the development in adults of greatly extended fin rays (two-thirds the standard length) from the tips of the upper and lower lobes of the forked caudal fin: the mostly balck African creole Wrasse with one filament on each lobe of the caudal, and the mostly mauve to purple Brazilian Creole Wrasse with two or more such filaments.

An understudied behavioural tactic is the follower-feeding association, in which individuals of a species follow (called ‚Äúfollower‚Äù) and benefit from the foraging activities of individuals of another species that disturbs the substrate (called ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù). Here, we investigated the incidence of this tactic at three oceanic islands in the southwestern Atlantic by characterizing pairwise, and the emergent network of follower-feeding associations. We quantified associations among species according to their trophic categories, activity period, and group size. The incidence of follower-feeding associations was higher at islands with higher species richness, but the proportion of associations per species was higher at islands with lower species richness. Overall, mobile invertebrate-feeders, omnivores and macrocarnivores were the most common trophic categories engaged in this tactic. Most of follower-feeding associations involved diurnal species, which indicates that followers rely on visual cues to engage in this tactic. We also found that nuclear species were mainly solitary, while followers tended to aggregate in small- to medium-sized groups. Our study indicates that follower-feeding association is an opportunistic yet frequent feeding tactic at oceanic islands, which may stem from resource partitioning in such remote habitats.",UNIV FED RIO GRANDE DO NORTE,NA,"CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [307340/2019-8, 310517/2019-2, 442417/2019-5]; COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIORCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES) [001]; INSTITUTO SERRAPILHEIRA [SERRA-1708-15364]",
INAGAKI KY 2020 GLOB CHANGE BIOL,2020,Trophic interactions will expand geographically but be less intense as oceans warm,Bayesian models; feeding pressure; future projections; latitudinal patterns; temperature; tropicalization; Western Atlantic,"Interactions among species are likely to change geographically due to climate-driven species range shifts and in intensity due to physiological responses to increasing temperatures. Marine ectotherms experience temperatures closer to their upper thermal limits due to the paucity of temporary thermal refugia compared to those available to terrestrial organisms. Thermal limits of marine ectotherms also vary among species and trophic levels, making their trophic interactions more prone to changes as oceans warm. We assessed how temperature affects reef fish trophic interactions in the Western Atlantic and modeled projections of changes in fish occurrence, biomass, and feeding intensity across latitudes due to climate change. Under ocean warming, tropical reefs will experience diminished trophic interactions, particularly herbivory and invertivory, potentially reinforcing algal dominance in this region. Tropicalization events are more likely to occur in the northern hemisphere, where feeding by tropical herbivores is predicted to expand from the northern Caribbean to extratropical reefs. Conversely, feeding by omnivores is predicted to decrease in this area with minor increases in the Caribbean and southern Brazil. Feeding by invertivores declines across all latitudes in future predictions, jeopardizing a critical trophic link. Most changes are predicted to occur by 2050 and can significantly affect ecosystem functioning, causing dominance shifts and the rise of novel ecosystems",UNIV FED RIO GRANDE DO NORTE,"LONGO, GO (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED RIO GRANDE DO NORTE, DEPT OCEANOG \& LIMNOL, LAB ECOL MARINHA, BR-59014002 NATAL, RN, BRAZIL","CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [307340/2019-8, 310517/2019-2, 442417/2019-5]; COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIORCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES) [001]; INSTITUTO SERRAPILHEIRA [SERRA-1708-15364]",

Such debris is reported in every habitat of the oceans, from urban tourist beaches to remote islands and from the ocean surface to submarine canyons, and is found buried and deposited on sandy and cobble beaches. Plastic marine debris varies from micrometres to several metres in length and is potentially ingested by animals of every level of the marine food web. Here, we show that synthetic polymers are present in subsurface plankton samples around Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago in the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean. To explain the distribution of microplastics around the Archipelago, we proposed a generalised linear model (GLM) that suggests the existence of an outward gradient of mean plastic-particle densities. Plastic items can be autochthonous or transported over large oceanic distances. One probable source is the small but persistent fishing fleet using the area.",NA,NA,NA,

THE PURPOSE OF THIS  STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE HYDROLOGY WATER MASSES CURRENTS AND  CHLOROPHYLL A CONTENT TO DETERMINE THE DYNAMICS OF PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS  AROUND THE ROCAS ATOLL. SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED IN JULY 2010 IN THE AREA  AROUND THE ATOLL USING THE RESEARCH VESSEL CRUZEIRO DO SUL OF THE  BRAZILIAN NAVY. TWO TRANSECTS WERE ESTABLISHED ACCORDING TO THE SURFACE  CURRENTS ONE OF WHICH AT THE SOUTHEAST OF THE ATOLL SE AND THE OTHER  AT NORWEST NW. THREE COLLECTION POINTS WERE DETERMINED ON EACH OF  THESE TRANSECTS. SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AT DIFFERENT DEPTHS SURFACE AND  DCM - DEEP CHLOROPHYLL MAXIMUM AND DIFFERENT TIMES DAY AND NIGHT.  ACCORDING TO PCA PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS THE NUTRIENTS ANALYZED  DIN DISSOLVED INORGANIC NITROGEN DIP DISSOLVED INORGANIC PHOSPHORUS  AND SILICATE WERE INVERSELY CORRELATED WITH TEMPERATURE AND DISSOLVED  OXYGEN. MOST ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE DUE  TO THE TURBULENCE ON THE NORTHWEST TRANSECT. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN  THE CONCENTRATION OF CHLOROPHYLL A AND NUTRIENTS WHEN THE TEMPERATURE  AND OXYGEN IN THE MIXED LAYER WAS REDUCED DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE  SACW SOUTH ATLANTIC CENTRAL WATER. DESPITE THE INCREASE OBSERVED IN  SOME VARIABLES SUCH AS NUTRIENT SALTS AND CHLOROPHYLL A THE TEMPERATURE  IN THE MIXED LAYER ATTAINED A MEAN VALUE OF 23.23 DEGREES C DUE TO THE  PREDOMINANCE OF TROPICAL WATER. THE INCREASE OF THE PHYTOPLANKTON  BIOMASS ON THE NW TRANSECT WAS THEREFORE CAUSED BY THE ``ISLAND  EFFECT'' AND NOT BY UPWELLING.,UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO,"JALES, MC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO, DEPT OCEANOG, AVE ARQUITETURA S-N,CIDADE UNIV, RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL",BOLSISTA FACEPE,

THE PRESENT STUDY  HAS AS MAIN OBJECTIVE THE COMPARISON OF THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF  ASSOCIATED ICTIOFAUNA IN ARTIFICIAL REEFS INTRODUCED IN TWO DISTINCT  PLACES CLOSE AND DISTANT FROM THE ROCKY SHORE. TWO GROUPS OF THREE  STRUCTURES REEF BALL TM WERE DISPOSED IN THE ISLAND JOAO DA  CUNHA/SC A GROUP LOCATED NEAR THE ROCKY SHORE AND THE OTHER WITH A  DISTANCE OF 50 METERS. THE STRATEGY OF VISUAL CENSUS WAS USED IN THE  ACCOMPANIMENT OF ICTIOFAUNA DONE BY LINEAR TRANSECTS IN THE MENTIONED  AREAS. THE FISHES WERE COUNTED AND IDENTIFIED TO THE LESSER POSSIBLE  TAXON. A TOTAL OF 19 SPECIES WERE IDENTIFIED STEGASTES FUSCUS WAS THE  MOST ABUNDANT IN THE AREA CLOSE TO THE ROCKY SHORE AND HAEMULON SP FOR  THE DISTANT POINTS. THE DIVERSITY WAS LARGER IN THE REEFS NEAR TO THE  ROCKYSHORE 0693 1925 NATS THEN IN THE DISTANT POINTS 060 1332  NATS. THE TOTAL ABUNDANCE ALSO PRESENTED A SIMILAR STANDARD PATTERN TO  THE DIVERSITY BEING HIGHER NEAR THE ROCKYSHORE. TWO DISTINCT SPECIES  ASSOCIATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED ONE IN DISTANT REEF POINTS COMPOSED BY  BATIGOBIUS SOPORATOR HAEMULON SP AND ANISOTREMUS VIRGINICUS AND  ANOTHER ASSOCIATION NEAR THE ROCKYSHORE COMPOSED BY SPARISSOMA SP  EPINEPHELUS MARGINATUS SPHOEROIDES TESTUDINEUS EUCINOSTOMUS SP  STEGASTES FUSCUS DIPLOPODUS ARGENTEUS PAREQUES ACUMINATUS AND  EPINEPHELUS MORIO. THE PRESENCE AND THE DISTANCE OF THE ROCKY SHORE WAS  SHOWN AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE COLONIZATION OF ARTIFICIAL REEFS.

THE LATTER BECAME MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT DURING  THE PAST FEW THOUSAND YEARS AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE `ANTHROPOCENE'.  HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT IN THIS RESPECT AS YET  MUCH LESS IS KNOWN FROM TROPICAL THAN FROM HIGH LATITUDE COASTS.  TROPICAL COASTS RECEIVE THE MAJORITY OF RIVER INPUTS INTO THE OCEAN  THEY HARBOR A VARIETY OF DIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS AND A MAJORITY OF THE  POPULATION LIVES THERE AND ECONOMICALLY DEPENDS ON THEIR NATURAL  RESOURCES. THIS REVIEW DELINEATES THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL RESPONSE OF COASTAL  SYSTEMS TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND THE INTERPLAY OF NATURAL AND  ANTHROPOGENIC CONTROL FACTORS NOWADAYS AND IN THE RECENT GEOLOGICAL PAST  WITH AN EMPHASIS ON TROPICAL REGIONS. WEATHERING RATES ARE HIGHER IN LOW  THAN IN HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS WITH A MAXIMUM IN THE SE ASIA/WESTERN  PACIFIC REGION. ON A GLOBAL SCALE THE NET EFFECT OF INCREASING EROSION  DUE TO DEFORESTATION AND SEDIMENT RETENTION BEHIND DAMS IS A REDUCED  SEDIMENT INPUT INTO THE OCEANS DURING THE ANTHROPOCENE. HOWEVER AN  INCREASE WAS OBSERVED IN THE SE ASIA/WESTERN PACIFIC REGION. NITROGEN  AND PHOSPHORUS INPUTS INTO THE OCEAN HAVE TREBLED BETWEEN THE 1970S AND  1990S DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITIES. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INCREASED NUTRIENT  INPUTS AND A CHANGE IN THE NUTRIENT MIX EXCESSIVE ALGAL BLOOMS AND  CHANGES IN THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY COMPOSITION TOWARDS  NON-BIOMINERALIZING SPECIES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN MANY REGIONS. THIS HAS  IMPLICATIONS FOR FOODWEBS AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES OF COASTAL SEAS  INCLUDING THE RELEASE OF GREENHOUSE GASES. EXAMPLES FROM TROPICAL COASTS  WITH HIGH POPULATION DENSITY AND EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURE HOWEVER DISPLAY  DEVIATIONS FROM TEMPERATE AND SUBTROPICAL REGIONS IN THIS RESPECT.  ACCORDING TO INSTRUMENTAL RECORDS AND OBSERVATIONS THE PRESENT-DAY  BIOGEOCHEMICAL AND ECOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE APPEARS  TO BE ON THE ORDER OF DECADES. A SEDIMENT RECORD FROM THE BRAZILIAN  CONTINENTAL MARGIN SPANNING THE PAST 85000 YEARS HOWEVER DEPICTS THAT  THE ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY CAN BE ON THE  ORDER OF 1000-2000 YEARS. THE COASTAL OCEAN CARBON CYCLE IS VERY  SENSITIVE TO ANTHROPOCENE CHANGES IN LAND-DERIVED CARBON AND NUTRIENT  FLUXES AND INCREASING ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE. AS OPPOSING TRENDS IN  HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS TROPICAL COASTAL SEAS DISPLAY INCREASING ORGANIC  MATTER INPUTS AND REDUCED CALCIFICATION RATES WHICH HAVE IMPORTANT  IMPLICATIONS FOR CALCIFYING ORGANISMS AND THE CARBON SOURCE OR SINK  FUNCTION OF THE COASTAL OCEAN. PARTICULARLY CORAL REEFS WHICH ARE  THRIVING IN WARM TROPICAL WATERS ARE SUFFERING FROM OCEAN ACIDIFICATION.  NEVERTHELESS THEY ARE NOT AFFECTED UNIFORMLY AND THE SENSITIVITY TO  OCEAN ACIDIFICATION MAY VARY LARGELY AMONG CORAL REEFS. THEREFORE THE  PREDICTION OF FUTURE SCENARIOS REQUIRES AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF  PRESENT AND PAST RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE WITH PARTICULAR  EMPHASIS PUT ON TROPICAL REGIONS.

METHODS THE DISJUNCT DISTRIBUTIONS OF THIRTY-FIVE REEF FISH SPECIES  OCCURRING IN THE BRAZILIAN PROVINCE WERE ANALYSED TO ALLOW A BETTER  UNDERSTANDING OF PRESENT BIOGEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS. TO AVOID POTENTIAL  BIAS BECAUSE OF TAXONOMIC PROBLEMS OR MISIDENTIFICATION WE ONLY  INCLUDED FAMILIES TAXONOMICALLY WELL DOCUMENTED WITH CONSPICUOUS  SPECIES AND RELATIVELY EASY TO IDENTIFY.  RESULTS THE LOW-LEVEL DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN CARIBBEAN AND BRAZILIAN  SPECIES/POPULATIONS AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OF RESTRICTED POPULATIONS  OF A FEW NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN SPECIES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AMAZON  RIVER CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THIS BARRIER TO DISPERSION CAN BE  OCCASIONALLY BRIDGED. TRANSOCEANIC DISPERSAL APPEARS TO BE FREQUENT AND  TO OCCUR ALONG THREE ROUTES FROM THE CARIBBEAN TO NORTH EAST ATLANTIC  FROM NORTHERN BRAZIL TO THE GULF OF GUINEA AND FROM AFRICA TO SOUTHERN  BRAZIL. INTERMEDIATE STEPPING-STONES ARE APPARENTLY NOT REQUIRED ALONG  TRANSATLANTIC ROUTES BECAUSE OF THE RARITY OF CONSECUTIVE COLONIZATIONS.

MOREOVER THE DEMOGRAPHIC CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THESE  MPAS AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS REGARDING THE MAINTENANCE OF BIODIVERSITY  ARE STILL NOT COMPREHENSIVELY UNDERSTOOD. AN INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODELING  SCHEME COUPLED WITH A REGIONAL HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL OF THE OCEAN IS USED  TO DETERMINE THE DEMOGRAPHIC CONNECTIVITY OF REEF FISHES BASED ON THE  WIDESPREAD GENUS SPARISOMA FOUND IN THE OCEANIC ISLANDS AND ON THE  BRAZILIAN CONTINENTAL SHELF BETWEEN 10 DEGREES N AND 23 DEGREES S. MODEL  RESULTS INDICATE THAT MPAS ARE HIGHLY ISOLATED DUE TO EXTREMELY LOW  DEMOGRAPHIC CONNECTIVITY. CONSEQUENTLY LOW CONNECTIVITY AND THE LONG  DISTANCES SEPARATING MPAS CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR ISOLATION. THEREFORE THE  CURRENT MPA DESIGN FALLS SHORT OF ITS GOAL OF MAINTAINING THE  DEMOGRAPHIC CONNECTIVITY OF SPARISOMA POPULATIONS LIVING WITHIN THESE  AREAS. IN AN EXTREME SCENARIO IN WHICH THE MPAS RELY SOLELY ON PROTECTED  POPULATIONS FOR RECRUITS IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO  EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE RESILIENCE OF THESE POPULATIONS OR OTHER  REEF FISH SPECIES SHARING THE SAME DISPERSAL ABILITIES.

ONLAP DOWNLAP TRUNCATION  LITHOFACIES BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND PALEO-WATER DEPTHS. BY USING THESE  OBSERVATIONS COUPLED TO A KINEMATIC AND FLEXURAL MODEL FOR THE  DEFORMATION OF THE LITHOSPHERE WE HAVE ELUCIDATED THE TECTONIC  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRESERVED STRATIGRAPHY THAT COMPRISES THE  GABON-CABINDA MARGIN OF WEST AFRICA. TWO HINGE ZONES AN EASTERN AND  ATLANTIC FORMED ALONG THE GABAN-CABINDA MARGIN IN RESPONSE TO THREE  DISCRETE EXTENSIONAL EVENTS OCCURRING FROM BERRIASIAN TO APTIAN TIME.  THE EASTERN HINGE ZONE DEMARCATES THE EASTERN LIMIT OF A BROADLY  DISTRIBUTED BERRIASIAN EXTENSION THAT RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF DEEP  ANOXIC LACUSTRINE SYSTEMS AS EVIDENCED BY THE SILTS AND SHALES OF THE  SIALIVAKOU AND LOWER DJENO FORMATIONS AND THE REGRESSIVE PACKAGES OF THE  UPPER DJENO FORMATION. APPROXIMATELY 1.5 TO 2 KM OF ASYMMETRIC FOOTWALL  UPLIFT WAS INDUCED ACROSS THE EASTERN HINGE ZONE IN RESPONSE TO THE  MECHANICAL UNLOADING OF THE LITHOSPHERE DURING THIS FIRST PHASE OF  RIFTING. IN CONTRAST THE ATLANTIC HINGE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 90 KM  WEST OF THE EASTERN HINGE MARKS THE EASTERN LIMIT OF A SECOND PHASE OF  EXTENSION THAT BEGAN IN THE HAUTERIVIAN. FOOTWALL UPLIFT AND ROTATION  EXPOSED EARLIER SYN-RIFT AND PRE-RIFT SEDIMENTS TO AT LEAST WAVEBASE  CAUSING VARYING AMOUNTS OF EROSIONAL TRUNCATION ACROSS THE ATLANTIC  HINGE ZONE ALONG MUCH OF THE GABON-CABINDA MARGINS. WE INTERPRET THE  THICKNESS VARIATIONS OF REWORKED ELASTIC SEDIMENT OF THIS AGE E.G. THE  MELANIA FORMATION BETWEEN THE HINGE ZONES AS INDICATIVE OF VARIATIONS  IN THE DEGREE OF UPLIFT AND EROSIONAL TRUNCATION OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE.  FOR EXAMPLE THE ABSENCE OF MELANIA FORMATION ACROSS THE CONGO MARGIN  IMPLIES THAT UPLIFT OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE WAS RELATIVELY MINOR COMPARED  TO THAT ACROSS THE CABINDA AND GABON MARGINS THE LATTER BEING  CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT THICKNESSES OF MELANIA FORMATION OR  EQUIVALENT. MATERIAL ERODED FROM THE CABINDA AND GABON ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONE MAY IN PART ACCOUNT FOR THE THICK WEDGE OF SEDIMENT DEPOSITED  SEAWARD OF THE GABON-CABINDA ATLANTIC HINGE THE ERVA FORMATION. OUR  MODELLING SUGGESTS THAT THIS WEDGE OF REWORKED ELASTICS REPRESENTS  DEPOSITION BY ALONG-AXIS GRAVITY FLOWS WITHIN A DEEP WATER APPROXIMATE  TO 2 KM ENVIRONMENT. A THIRD AND FINAL PHASE OF EXTENSION IN THE LATE  BARREMIAN-EARLY APTIAN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BREACHING THE CONTINENTAL  LITHOSPHERE TO FARM THE OCEAN/CONTINENT BOUNDARY AND THUS THE  INSTALLATION OF OPEN MARINE CONDITIONS. ELSEWHERE THE ENVIRONMENTS WILL  TEND TO BE MARGINAL MARINE TO BRACKISH DEPENDING ON THE EFFICIENCY OF  THE ATLANTIC HINGE ZONE TO ACT AS A BARRIER TO MARINE ENCHROACHMENT.  THIS THIRD RIFT PHASE REACTIVATED BOTH THE EASTERN AND ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONES THEREBY CREATING ACCOMMODATION FOR THE MARNES NOIRES FORMATION  AND EQUIVALENT SOURCE ROCK DEPOSITION BETWEEN THE HINGES AND THE  FALCAO SOURCE ROCK EQUIVALENT SEAWARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE. TWO  POSSIBLE SCENARIOS EXIST FOR THE LATERAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE MARNES  NOIRES FORMATION IF THE REACTIVATED RIFT FLANK TOPOGRAPHY ACROSS THE  ATLANTIC HINGE WAS SIGNIFICANT THEN SEDIMENTATION WOULD BE RESTRICTED  BETWEEN THE HINGE ZONES WITHIN DISCRETE LACUSTRINE SETTINGS E.G. CONGO  MARGIN ALTERNATIVELY IF HINGE ZONE UPLIFT WAS RELATIVELY MINOR THEN  A CORAL-RIMMED ARCHIPELAGO MAY HAVE DEVELOPED PARALLEL TO THE MARGIN  WITH RESTRICTED COMMUNICATION ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HINGE ZONE E.G.   CABINDA MARGIN IN THIS LATTER SCENARIO DILUTION OF THE MARNES  NOIRES SOURCE ROCKS BY TERRIGENOUS INPUT FROM THE ERODING ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONE SHOULD BE RELATIVELY MINOR THEREBY ENHANCING SOURCE ROCK QUALITY  FURTHERMORE POTENTIAL MARINE UPWELLING OUTBOARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONE IS LIKELY THE CAUSE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND ACCUMULATION OF  ORGANIC-RICH MATERIAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE FALCAO SOURCE ROCK OF THE  KWANZA BASIN. BY LATE APTIAN TIME THE REMAINING ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN  THE HINGE ZONES WAS PARTIALLY FILLED BY ACROSS-AND ALONG-AXIS PROGRADING  DELTAIC SYSTEMS OF THE ARGILLES VERTES AND TCHIBOTA FORMATIONS. THE  PROGRADATION AND INTERACTION OF THE ARGILLES VERTES DEPOSITIONAL LOBES  RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF RESIDUAL PALEO-RELIEF. SUBSEQUENT MARINE  INCURSIONS AND FLOODING OF THIS PALEO-RELIEF LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF  BASAL CONGLOMERATES THE CHELA `LAG' UNCONFORMITY GRADING UPWARD INTO  FINE-GRAINED SANDS AND EVAPORITES CONSEQUENTLY AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP  SHOULD EXIST BETWEEN EVAPORITE THICKNESS IN PARTICULAR THE LOWER  MEMBERS AND THE THICKNESS OF THE UNDERLYING ARGILLES VERTES AND  TCHIBOTA FORMATIONS. VARIATIONS IN LOEME EVAPORITE THICKNESS IS A  CONSEQUENCE OF STRATIGRAPHIC AND STRUCTURAL CONTROL WITH SALT  INSTABILITY INFLUENCING LOCAL VARIABILITY  OUR MODELING SUGGESTS THE OCCURRENCE OF TWO DISTINCT EVAPORITE SEQUENCES  ON THE CONGO MARGIN AN EARLIER EVAPORITE DEPOSITED SEAWARD WEST OF  THE ATLANTIC HINGE DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD RIFT PHASES AND THE LATE  APTIAN LOEME FORMATION DEPOSITED BETWEEN THE HINGE ZONES. AN EVAPORITE  SEQUENCE SEAWARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE IS INFERRED ON THE BASIS OF  EXTENSIVE DIAPIRS AND SALT TECTONIC STRUCTURES OBSERVED IN SEISMIC DATA.  IN ORDER TO MATCH THE DISTRIBUTION AND THICKNESS OF THE OBSERVED  POST-SALT STRATIGRAPHY ACROSS THE BASIN HOWEVER WE REQUIRE LARGE  PALEOWATER DEPTHS WEST OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE DURING THE LATER APTIAN  THE EXISTENCE OF LARGE PALEOWATER DEPTHS PRECLUDES THE FORMATION OF  THICK EVAPORITE SEQUENCES WITHIN THE OUTER BASIN CONSEQUENTLY WE  PROPOSE THAT THE EVAPORITES SEAWARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE WERE FORMED  DURING THE SYN-RIFT DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARGIN AND ARE NOT  CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THE POST-RIFT LOEME SALTS DEPOSITED BETWEEN THE  HINGE ZONES.

HOWEVER COLONIES  OF THIS SPECIES THAT WERE MAINTAINED FOR ONE YEAR IN A CLOSED AQUARIUM  SYSTEM AT A CONSTANT TEMPERATURE OF 26 DEGREES C 02 DEGREES C AND 12 H  OF ILLUMINATION ALSO FORMED A NEW AND COMPLETE DENSITY CYCLE DESPITE THE  ABSENCE OF SEASONALITY IN TEMPERATURE AND PHOTOPERIOD DURING THE  EXPERIMENT. THIS RESULT IMPLIES THAT THE PRIMARY CUE FOR DENSITY BANDING  IS ENDOGENOUS POSSIBLY THE REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE AND THAT TEMPERATURE  PLAYS A SECONDARY ROLE IN FINE-TUNING THE BANDING CYCLE. THUS WE  CONCLUDE THAT THIS SPECIES CAN BE USED AS AN ARCHIVE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL  PARAMETERS. ON THE OTHER HAND IT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE ENVIRONMENTAL  IMPACTS INDUCED BY HUMAN ACTION AND/OR BY GLOBAL CLIMATIC CHANGES ON THE  GROWTH OF CORALS IN RECENT DECADES AND CENTURIES ALONG THE COAST AND THE  CONTINENTAL SHELF OF THE TROPICAL WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN.

FEW REEF SURVEYS WERE PERFORMED IN THE 90‚Äö√Ñ√¥S IN REEF AREAS OF BAHIA STATE PARTICULARLY IN THE ABROLHOS REEF COMPLEX IN THE SOUTHERNMOST SIDE OF THE STATE. A MONITORING PROGRAM APPLYING THE ATLANTIC AND GULF RAPID REEF ASSESSMENT AGRRA PROTOCOL WAS INITIATED IN 2000 IN THE ABROLHOS NATIONAL MARINE PARK AFTER THE CREATION OF THE SOUTH TROPICAL AMERICA STA REGIONAL NODE OF THE GLOBAL CORAL REEF MONITORING NETWORK GCRMN BY THE END OF 1999. FROM THAT TIME UP TO 2005 NINE REEF SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED ALONG THE COAST OF THE STATE OF BAHIA INCLUDING 26 REEFS WITH 95 BENTHIC SITES 280 BENTHIC TRANSECTS 2025 QUADRATS AND 3537 STONY CORALS. EIGHTEEN OF THE 26 INVESTIGATED REEFS WERE ASSESSED ONCE AND EIGHT REEFS OF ABROLHOS WERE SURVEYED TWICE TO FOUR TIMES. THE MDS ORDINATION ANALYSIS OF SIMILARITY ANOSIM ONE WAY AND TWO-WAY NESTED LAYOUTS AND SIMILARITY PERCENTAGES SIMPER TESTS WERE APPLIED TO INVESTIGATE THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF REEF VITALITY. FOUR INDICATORS OF THE CORAL VITALITY LIVE CORAL COVER THE DENSITY OF THE LARGER CORALS COLONIES >20CM PER REEF SITE AND OF THE CORAL RECRUITS COLONIES<2CM PER SQUARE METER AND THE PERCENTAGE OF MACROALGAE INDICATE THAT THE NEARSHORE REEFS WHICH ARE LOCATED LESS THAN 5KM FROM THE COAST ARE IN POORER CONDITION THAN THE REEFS LOCATED MORE THAN 5KM OFF THE COAST. A HIGHER DENSITY OF CORAL COLONIES LOWER MACROALGAL INDEX HIGHER RELATIVE PERCENT OF TURF ALGAE AND HIGHER DENSITY OF CORAL RECRUITS IN OFFSHORE REEFS COMPARED TO THE NEARSHORE REEFS ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN 80% TO THE DISSIMILARITY BETWEEN THEM. THE OFFSHORE REEFS ARE IN BETTER VITAL CONDITION THAN THE NEARHORE REEFS AND HAVE A SET OF VITALITY INDICES MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE NORTHWESTERN ATLANTIC REEFS THAN THE NEARSHORE REEF. THESE HAVE BEEN MOST SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF DIRECT HUMAN ACTIVITIES SUCH AS EUTHROPHIC WATERS ASSOCIATED WITH SEWAGE POLLUTION HIGHER SEDIMENTATION RATES AND WATER TURBIDITY INADEQUATE USE OF THE REEFS AND OVER EXPLOITATION OF THEIR RESOURCES. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A MORE EFFECTIVE CORAL REEF MONITORING PROGRAM IN BAHIA IS MANDATORY IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE STRATEGIES FOR PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT EFFORTS OF THE REEFS. REV. BIOL.

Compilation of available data on the distribution of azooxanthellate corals between 24¬∞ and 35¬∞ S, compared with the distribution of bottom-longline, bottom-gillnets, trawl and trap fisheries shows that commercial fishing takes place over coral areas, providing evidence deep-sea reefs are important reservoirs of deep marine biodiversity. Since the initial phase of exploitation by demersal fisheries, onboard observers are describing large captures of corals as ‚Äúbycatch‚Äù suggesting deep-sea communities are being destroyed even before being studied. In order to ensure protection of deep-sea coral ecosystems and economic sustainability of demersal fisheries in southern Brazilian waters, adoption of excluded fishing areas in those locations where azooxanthellate Scleractinia occur is strongly recommended.",JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND,"KITAHARA, MV (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), JAMES COOK UNIV N QUEENSLAND, CORAL GENOM GRP, MOL SCI BLG,RM 002,DOUGLAS CAMPUS, TOWNSVILLE, QLD 4811, AUSTRALIA",NA,

However, several of these colonial species are small-sized and are usually found in shallow waters.

Cnidarians are an entirely venomous group that utilize their proteinaceous-dominated toxins to capture prey and defend against predators, in addition to several other ecological functions, including intraspecific interactions. At present there are no studies describing the venom for any species within cerianthids. Given their unique development, ecology, and distinct phylogenetic-placement within Cnidaria, our objective is to evaluate the venom-like gene diversity of four species of cerianthids from newly collected transcriptomic data. We identified 525 venom-like genes between all four species. The venom-gene profile for each species was dominated by enzymatic protein and peptide families, which is consistent with previous findings in other cnidarian venoms. However, we found few toxins that are typical of sea anemones and corals, and furthermore, three of the four species express toxin-like genes closely related to potent pore-forming toxins in box jellyfish. Our study is the first to provide a survey of the putative venom composition of cerianthids and contributes to our general understanding of the diversity of cnidarian toxins",NA,NA,NA,

The results showed that: 1) bottom disturbance was the strongest attraction factor for follower reef fishes; 2) visual features of the nuclear also attracted follower reef fishes; 3) there was no evidence of an interaction between bottom disturbance and nuclear fish appearance in the attraction of followers, supporting the idea that both factors independently elicit following behaviour by reef fishes.",UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS,"KRAJEWSKI, JP (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS, PROGRAMA POS GRAD ECOL, DEPT ZOOL \& MUSEU HIST NAT, UNICAMP, CP 6109, BR-13083970 CAMPINAS, SP, BRAZIL",CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); FAPESPFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP),

MATERIAL WAS  COLLECTED FROM TWO SITES ON A MIXED CARBONATE-SILICICLASTIC SHELF OFF  THE COAST OF BRAZIL WHERE BOTH SPECIES ARE DOMINANT COMPONENTS OF THE  LOCAL FAUNA.  INDIVIDUAL SHELLS N = 178 WERE DATED USING AMINO ACID RACEMIZATION  ASPARTIC ACID CALIBRATED WITH 24 AMS RADIOCARBON DATES. SHELL AGES  RANGE FROM MODERN TO 8118 YEARS B.P. FOR BRACHIOPODS AND MODERN TO 4437  YEARS FOR BIVALVES. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE SHAPE AND CENTRAL  TENDENCY OF AGE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE APPARENT BETWEEN EACH  SAMPLE. SUCH DIFFERENCES IN TIME-AVERAGING MAGNITUDE CONFIRM THE  ASSUMPTION THAT TAPHONOMIC PROCESSES ARE SUBJECT TO STOCHASTIC VARIATION  AT ALL SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. DESPITE THESE DIFFERENCES EACH  SAMPLE IS TEMPORALLY INCOMPLETE AT CENTENNIAL RESOLUTION AND THREE OF  THE FOUR SAMPLES HAVE SIMILAR RIGHT-SKEWED AGE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS.  SIMULATIONS OF TEMPORAL COMPLETENESS INDICATE THAT SAMPLES OF BOTH  SPECIES FROM THE SHALLOW SITE ARE CONSISTENT WITH A MORE STRONGLY  RIGHT-SKEWED AND LESS-COMPLETE AGE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION THAN THOSE  FROM THE DEEP SITE.  WE CONCLUDE THAT INTRINSIC CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH SPECIES EXERT LESS  CONTROL ON THE TIME-AVERAGING SIGNATURE OF THESE SAMPLES THAN DO  EXTRINSIC FACTORS SUCH AS VARIATION IN RATES OF SEDIMENTATION AND  TAPHONOMIC DESTRUCTION.

DATA OBTAINED WHICH ARE SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN VALUES  CURRENTLY INDICATED WERE USED FOR SUGGESTING ANSWERS TO TWO PENDING  QUESTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE LATE PLEISTOCENE AND HOLOCENE SEA LEVEL  RISE. THE FIRST QUESTION INVOLVES THE EXISTENCE AND DURATION OF  STILLSTANDS DURING THE HOLOCENE TRANSGRESSION. NUMEROUS LITTORAL  NOTCHES PRODUCED BY SUBMERSION AT CONSTANT DEPTHS ALLOW US TO PROPOSE  THAT CUMULATIVE STILLSTAND TIME MAY HAVE BEEN A FEW THOUSAND YEARS. THIS  IMPLIES THAT STILLSTANDS WERE FOLLOWED BY EPISODES OF VERY RAPID SEA  LEVEL RISE AND THAT SEA LEVEL CURVES ARE MORE STEPPED THAN IS GENERALLY  INDICATED BY CORAL REEF STUDIES.

"Laborel, J ICRS3",1977,Are reef-building vermetids disappearing in the south Atlantic?,"Biogeography, Reefs, Mollusks, Vermetid, Gastropods, South Atlantic","Extensive formations of Gastropods of the family vermetidae have often been described from the intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical regions. In the tropical Atlantic, the study of 19th and early 20th century literature shows that very dense populations of Vermetids (often quoted as Serpulae) were active in areas wh~re recent exploration is not able to find them. In some areas, populations which flourished 70 years ago, have now completely vanished. Similarly studies of fossil vermetid rock lines above present water level, representative of holocene high water stands along the coasts of Brazil and West Africa, reveal that fossil populations of these species were more developed and more widely distributed than at present. The various genera of Vermetids have not been affected to the same extent. Petaloconchus (Macrophragma) , which prefers relatively calm waters, is nearly extinct in the region of our study; whereas Dendropoma (Novastoa) , a surf loving genus, survives and is still flourishing in many places. It is still premature to propose an explanation for such ~henomena. We do not know whether it is worldwide, or restricted. However, it does not seem to be linked to human activity, since the general narrowing of the areas of repartition suggests climatic changes.",NA,NA,NA,

They form cold-water reefs in the upper bathyal zone on continental margins and offshore banks [A.D. Rogers, Int. Rev. Hydrobiol. 84 (1999) 315]. Lophelia is classified in the family Caryophylliidae and Madrepora in the family Oculinidae, both on the basis of skeletal morphology. Recent molecular studies of the scleractinians have given a new insight into the evolutionary history of this group. This study was aimed at clarifying the phylogenetic relationships of Lophelia and Madrepora, through the analysis of partial sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA. Sequences were obtained for samples of L. pertusa collected in the northeast Atlantic and off Brazil, M. oculata, four other deep-sea and eight tropical coral species from the R√©union island in the Indian Ocean. The sequences were aligned with 69 homologous sequences of Scleractinia. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses support previously published molecular topologies. The two specimens of L. pertusa grouped with two caryophylliids, confirming the existing classification of the species, but the large genetic distance between the two Lophelia samples suggests that these populations are genetically isolated from one another. M. oculata did not cluster with oculinids, but formed a monotypic clade lying between the families Pocilloporidae and Caryophyliidae. Phylogenetic analysis also suggested cryptic speciation within the tropical taxa Pocillopora meandriana and possibly Acropora humilis.",UNIV SOUTHAMPTON,"LE GOFF-VITRY, MC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SOUTHAMPTON, SCH OCEAN \& EARTH SCI, SOUTHAMPTON OCEANOG CTR, SOUTHAMPTON SO14 3ZH, HANTS, ENGLAND",NA,

The present work analysed the association and behaviour of reef fish on the fire coral Millepora alcicornis and M. brasiliensis from September 2010 to February 2011, on the coastal reefs of Tamandar ÃÅe, north-east Brazil. A total of 473 reef fish individuals of 27 species were sighted associated with the coral colonies, mainly composed of juveniles (65%). The most frequently observed behaviours were sheltered/stationary and swimming close to the coral; however, individuals were also observed foraging and breeding among Millepora spp. branching colonies. The agonistic behaviour performed by Stegastes fuscus individuals was highlighted in the present study, especially against Chaetodon striatus, Diodon holacanthus and Ophioblennius trinitatis individuals. Millepora spp. hydrocorals are ecologically important for juvenile and adult reef fish belonging to several trophic guilds. The complex structure of the coral colonies provides a wide variety of ecological functions on coral reefs (e.g. shelter, reproduction area, food and even territory). Nevertheless, the abundance of branching fire coral in Brazilian reefs have been declining over the past years; therefore, efforts must be made to protect this key habitat.",NA,NA,NA,

The tendency to form these unusual growth forms starts very early, when juvenile coral colonies develop the mushroom head which seems to result from the death of the surface of the parent coral, followed by growth of the colony along the edges. In the tall, mature columns, the expansion of their tops is accentuated by the prolific growth of photophile corals when ""the reefs reach sea level. Under the overhangs, where penetration of light is limited, only the sciaphile forms of corals can grow. Where the growth of these reef columns is dense, they coalesce by their tops forming large compound reef structures that do not display the distinctive zones of the world's living coral reef models. They are shallow bank reefs with a truncated top, an extremely irregular windward side that drops abruptly into deeper waters and lacks the spur and groove system,and without a characteristic back reef zone. These reef columns initiated at depths ranging between 10 and lsm""above Pleistocene carbonate deposits, on the shelf bank reefs, and above non-reefal substrates of older ages, on the shallow reefs adjacent to the coastline.

LEAO 2003 LATIN AMERICAN CORAL REEFS,2003,Corals and coral reefs of Brazil ,,"The Brazilian coral reefs form structures significantly different from the well known coral reef models, because (i) they have a characteristic initial growth form of mushroom-shaped coral pinnacles called ‚ÄúchapeiroÃÉes‚Äù, (ii) they are build by a very low diversity coral fauna, rich in endemic species, which are relic forms, remnant of an ancient coral fauna dating back in the Tertiary, (iii) incrusting coralline algae have an important role in the construction of the reef structure, and (iv) the nearshore bank reefs are surrounded and even filled with muddy siliciclastic sediments. The isolated reefs columns, the ‚ÄúchapeiroÃÉes‚Äù, fuse together at their tops, forming large compound reef structures of varied sizes, with horizontal tops, and somewhat irregular shape. They can be completely exposed during low tides. These reef structures are distributed into three major sectors along the tropical coast of Brazil: the northern, the northeastern and the eastern coasts. There are different types of bank reefs, fringing reefs and an atoll. Corals, milleporids and coralline algae build the rigid frame of the reefs. The coral fauna, so far identified, comprises less than eighteen species, being some of them endemic to the Brazilian waters. Quaternary sea-level fluctuations affected the growth of the reefs in Brazil; transgressive and regressive seas marked different stages of reef development. The areas where the major coral reefs occur correspond to regions where nearby urban centres are experiencing accelerated growth and tourist development is increasing very fast. The major human impacts to the reef ecosystem are mostly associated with agricultural activities (sugarcane and timber), mineral and chemical industries and oil exploration. Increased sedimentation due to removal of the Atlantic rainforest and the disposal of industrial and urban effluents, are additional stresses to the coastal marine environment in Brazil. There are not many institutions concerned with preservation of the Brazilian coral reefs, and they are also fairly new.

Until 5 Ky BP, reefs developed upward to compensate for a transgressive sea level, exhibiting a framework mainly composed of the endemic coral Mussismilia braziliensis, with colonies reaching up to 1 m in diameter. A 5 m sea level lowering that occurred after this period exposed the nearshore reefs to solar radiation and high influx of terrigenous sediment, causing a catastrophic coral cover decline, from a maximum of 14.5% in fossil reefs to a maximum of 3.5% in living reefs. Currently, reefs are experiencing increasing degradation due to a synergism of natural processes and anthropogenic perturbations such as eutrophic waters, marine pollution, inadequate use, and over-exploitation of reef resources. Bleaching events that registered in the summer of 1993/94, 1997/98, and 2002/03 did not cause mass mortality to the eastern Brazilian coastal reefs, and after six months all bleached corals recovered. Recent studies indicate that annual average rates of sediment accumulation (> 15 mg cm-2 day-1) seem to be detrimental for the vital condition of the coral fauna from the Abrolhos region and an inverse relationship has been found between sediment accumulation and some biotic parameters. Moreover, the results of three years monitoring at the Abrolhos National Marine Park reefs indicate coral damage in sites where intensive diving is permitted. Nutrification of coastal waters, due to contamination of groundwater by domestic sewage, is affecting the community structure of the nearshore reefs in North Bahia, and it is favoring the activity of planktivorous reef macroborers",NA,NA,NA,

There were no mass coral death associated to these events and the affected corals fully recovered after the impact. The first occurrence was registered during the southern hemisphere summer of 1993/1994, in Abrolhos, when 50 to 90% of the coral colonies were bleached. In the North Coast of Bahia, during the summer of 1997/1998, a sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly of 1 ¬∞C matched with SST registered in the field (29 to 30.5 ¬∞C). As a result, up to 60% corals bleached. From 1998 to 2005 anomalies of 0.25 ¬∞C, for two weeks, caused bleaching in more than 10% corals from the coastal reefs, which are located adjacent or less than 5 km from the coastline. However in the Abrolhos region, where reefs are located more than 10 km from the continent, only SST anomalies higher than 0.50 ¬∞C, persisting for more than two weeks, caused bleaching up to 10% of the investigated corals. Mussismilia hispida, Siderastrea spp., Montastraea cavernosa, Agaricia agaricites and Porites astreoides were the coral species most severely impacted by bleaching, and they are also the most common species in the coastal reefs. All species presented different levels of bleaching, ‚Äòlight‚Äô or ‚Äòheavy‚Äô. In Bahia, there is a strong linkage between coral bleaching and periods of elevated sea surface temperature, and the most affected corals were the ones from the coastal reefs. These coastal reefs are exposed to the impacts from processes occurring in the continent, suggesting that corals exposed to high levels of nutrient and sediment loads, and large SST fluctuations, may be more resistant to the post bleaching effects, such as infectious diseases and mass mortality.",UNIV FED BAHIA,"LEAO, ZMAN (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED BAHIA, GPGG IGEO, RUA CAETANO MOURA 123, BR-40210340 SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL",NA,

Indicators of reef vitality reveal that reefs located less than 5 km from the coastline, the inshore reefs, are in poorer conditions than those located more than 5 km off the coast, the offshore reefs. The inshore reefs are the most impacted by the effects of eutrophic waters associated with sewage pollution, high sedimentation rates and water turbidity, and the most exposed to the effects of bleaching and infectious diseases. From 1998 to 2005, long-term sea water thermal anomaly events, equal or higher than 1oC, were responsible for more than 30% of bleached corals in the inshore reefs. In the offshore reefs of the Abrolhos area, bleaching was milder, but the reefs are strongly threatened by the incidence of diseases that have escalated in prevalence from negligible to alarmingly high levels in recent years. Although bleaching and coral disease have not yet caused mass mortality in the Brazilian reefs, these natural disturbances associated with the effects of global climate changes and human-induced activities, could lead the reefs to higher levels of degradation.",UNIV FED BAHIA,"LEAO, ZMAN (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED BAHIA, GPGG IGEO, RUA CAETANO MOURA 123, BR-40210340 SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL",NA,

The reefs are distributed in the following four major sectors along the Brazilian coast: the northern, the northeastern and the eastern regions, and the oceanic islands, but certain isolated coral species can be found in warmer waters in embayments of the southern region. There are different types of bank reefs, fringing reefs, isolated chapeiroes and an atoll present along the Brazilian coast. Corals, milleporids and coralline algae build the rigid frame of the reefs. The areas in which the major coral reefs occur correspond to regions in which nearby urban centers are experiencing accelerated growth, and tourism development is rapidly increasing. The major human effects on the reef ecosystem are mostly associated with the increased sedimentation due to the removal of the Atlantic rainforest and the discharge of industrial and urban effluents.

Even though bacteria have previously been described in early life stages of corals, these early life stages (larvae) could have been inoculated in the water and not inside the parental colony (through gametes) carrying the parental microbiome. How Symbiodinium is transmitted to offspring is also not clear, as only one study has described this mechanism in spawners. All other studies refer to incubators. To explore the VT hypothesis and the key components being transferred, colonies of the broadcast spawner species Mussismilia hispida were kept in nurseries until spawning. Gamete bundles, larvae and adult corals were analyzed to identify their associated microbiota with respect to composition and location. Symbiodinium and bacteria were detected by sequencing in gametes and coral planula larvae. However, no cells were detected using microscopy at the gamete stage, which could be related to the absence of those cells inside the oocytes/dispersed in the mucus or to a low resolution of our approach. A preliminary survey of Symbiodinium diversity indicated that parental colonies harbored Symbiodinium clades B, C and G, whereas only clade B was found in oocytes and planula larvae [5 days after fertilization (a.f.)]. The core bacterial populations found in the bundles, planula larvae and parental colonies were identified as members of the genera Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia, Inquilinus and Bacillus, suggesting that these populations could be vertically transferred through the mucus. The collective data suggest that spawner corals, such as M. hispida, can transmit Symbiodinium cells and the bacterial core to their offspring by a coral gamete (and that this gamete, with its bacterial load, is released into the water), supporting the HTE. However, more data are required to indicate the stability of the transmitted populations to indicate whether the holobiont can be considered a unit of natural selection or a symbiotic assemblage of independently evolving organisms.",INST MICROBIOL PROF PAULO DE GOES,"PEIXOTO, RS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), INST MICROBIOL PROF PAULO DE GOES, LAB ECOL MICROBIANA MOL, RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL",NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION (CAPES)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH SUPPORT OF RIO DE JANEIRO STATE (FAPERJ)FUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ),

Here, we explored the spatial-temporal dynamics, diversity and interactions of variable and core bacterial populations associated with the coral Mussismilia hispida and the surrounding water. This survey was performed on five reefs along a transect from the coast (Reef 1) to offshore (Reef 5), representing a gradient of influence of the river mouth, for almost 12 months (4 sampling times), in the dry and rainy seasons. A clear increasing gradient of organic-pollution proxies (nitrogen content and fecal coliforms) was observed from Reef 1 to Reef 5, during both seasons, and was highest at the Buranh√©m River mouth (Reef 1). Conversely, a clear inverse gradient of the network analysis of the whole bacterial communities also revealed more-complex network relationships at Reef 5. Our data also indicated a higher relative abundance of members of the bacterial core, dominated by Acinetobacter sp., at Reef 5, and higher diversity of site-stable bacterial populations, likely related to the higher abundance of total coliforms and N content (proxies of sewage or organic pollution) at Reef 1, during the rainy season. Thus, the less ‚Äúpolluted‚Äù areas may show a more-complex network and a high relative abundance of members of the bacterial core (almost 97% in some cases), resulting in a more-homogeneous and well-established bacteriome among sites/samples, when the influence of the river is stronger (rainy seasons).",INST MICROBIOL PROF PAULO DE GOES,"PEIXOTO, RS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), INST MICROBIOL PROF PAULO DE GOES, LAB ECOL MICROBIANA MOL, RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL",NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION (CAPES)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH SUPPORT OF RIO DE JANEIRO STATE (FAPERJ)FUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ),

The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial and temporal variations in macrobenthic populations of the intertidal zones of the Formosa, Areia Vermelha, Picaozinho and Seixas coastal reefs in Paraiba, Brazil. The evaluation will serve as a basis for characterizing the conservation status of these reefs and for developing a monitoring program. To determine conservation status, we adapted the Ecological Evaluation Index continuous formula (EEI-c) and obtained an indicator value (IndVal) for each of the identified species to select the most informative species for monitoring purposes. With the exception of rugosity, the environmental variables exhibited only temporal variations, likely reflecting the shared coastal oceanographic influences.

(2011) based on EEI-c values, the conservation status of the reef environments of Joao Pessoa and Cabedelo was satisfactory and was not affected by tourism, since the environmental quality of the control area with no tourism (Formosa Reef) was similar than that of the other reefs during the period with the highest flow of tourists. The species selected by IndVal, except for Acanthophora spicifera in Areia Vermelha, were bioindicators of areas with low impacts. Similar to other bioindicator species from impacted areas, the occurrence of A. spicifera was considered seasonal, not representative of a warning sign. The present study demonstrates that existing low-cost, non destructive methods can be adapted to evaluate the conservation status and develop monitoring procedures for the coastal reefs of Brazil",NA,NA,NA,

However, gonad histology remains the most robust way to identify sexual patterns in fishes. Some uncommon tissues remain poorly described, such as the accessory gonadal structures found in species from the Gobiidae family, which are rare in other bony fishes. This is the first report of the testicular gland in Gramma brasiliensis and for the Grammatidae family. Between April 2011 and February 2012 eighty specimens were collected during four dive campaigns on the Taipus de Fora reef (13¬∞56‚Äô20‚ÄùS 38¬∞55‚Äô32‚ÄùW), Bahia, Northeast Brazil, and their sex was determined. Thirteen per cent of the active-females and 90% of the active-males had testicular gland tissue in their ovotestis. This discovery led to additional research into the characteristics of the gland tissue and its relationship with gonadal maturation. Three patterns of testicular gland development were found in Brazilian basslet ovotestis. Both ova and sperm-producing gonad contained testicular gland tissue, and the appearance of this tissue seems to be the first modification of ovotestis tissue marking the beginning of the protogynous sex-change process in G. brasiliensis.",LAB VERTEBRADOS AQUAT,"LEITE, JR (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UFES, CEUNES, DCAB, LAB VERTEBRADOS AQUAT,POSGRAD OCEANOG AMBIENTAL, RODOVIA BR 101 NORTE,KM 60,LITORANEO S-N, BR-29932540 SAO MATEUS, ES, BRAZIL",FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESPIRITO SANTO; PETROBRAS - PROGRAMA PETROBRAS AMBIENTALPETROBRAS,

Eighty-nine species were cited by the fishers and 44.1% are important commercial fish in the region. The fishers cited five distinct zones used to fish: border zone (68 species), estuary (41 spp.), artificial reef (27 spp.), ""malacacheta"" (24 spp.), and open ocean (10 spp.). The fishery resources were classified according to their gastronomic and economic characteristics: primary fish (35 spp.), secondary fish (32 spp.), mixed fish (10 spp.), discarded fish (7 spp.), and fish used as bait (5 spp.). The price of the target species increases along the production chain due to the greater number of people involved, processing costs, and improvement of the product.

LIMA JS 2020 ESTAR COAST SHELF SCI,2020,Could artificial reefs increase access to estuarine fishery resources? Insights from a long-term assessment,rtificial habitats; Commercial fish; Local fisheries; Coastal management,"Artificial reefs (ARs) have been used globally to increase fish stocks, especially for local fisheries, but few studies have addressed the seasonal changes in fish attracted to ARs over extended periods. Bottom gillnets were used twice a year (wet versus dry seasons) to investigate how the composition and structure of fishing resources change over seasons during 20 years in the oldest experimental AR complex deployed in Southeastern Brazil. In total, 74 fish species were caught, and Sciaenidae, Carangidae and Ariidae families were the most representative in both numbers and occurrence. Fish abundance, species richness and biomass varied significantly between AR and reference site (RS), with higher values being recorded in the artificial habitats. Generalized additive models and ANOVA showed a gradual transition over time for the fish assemblages associated with the reef complex, indicating an initial phase primarily dominated by estuarine species, followed by an extended period of attraction by reef-associated fish and many species of commercial interest. The season was identified as the most important factor for the development of fish assemblages in the AR complex. Fish abundance increased gradually towards the 14th year after AR deployment and became more variable thereafter, with the stabilization or a abundance decreasing for some species. Our findings reveal that AR might be locally important for commercial species such as Rhizhoprionodon porosus, Macrodon ancylondon and Isopisthus parvipinnis, and highlight the importance of structurally complex structures as a promising strategy to enhance the attraction of fishery resources",UNIV NORTH RIO DE JANEIRO,"ZALMON, IR (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV NORTH RIO DE JANEIRO, CTR BIOSCI \& BIOTECHNOL, CAMPOS GOYTACAZES, RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL",FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH SUPPORT CAPES; FAPERJFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ); RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF RIO DE JANEIRO - FAPERJFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ) [E-26/203.002/2016]; BRAZILIAN AGENCY FOR RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [301084/2016-5]; COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR -BRASIL (CAPES)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES) [001],

Integrated evaluations of ARs are necessary to comprehend the condition and benefits of these structures. Multimetric indices (ARMIs) were developed to evaluate fish assemblages associated with artificial structures and to assess the efficiency of the AR compared to control area (CA). The AR global ranking index (ARMI(r)) and AR local effect index (ARMI(e)) include 16 metrics that represent four broad levels of the fish community: structure of fish assemblages, trophic structure, vulnerability and economic importance. Individual metrics were evaluated using a long-term dataset of fish assemblages from the AR and CA in northern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Bottom gillnets were used to sample the fish two times per year for 21 years after creating the reef. The ARMI(r) general score for the AR was 51 out of a possible 100, with scores varying from 38 to 54. The ARMI(r) general score for the CA was 39 out of 100, with scores varying from 35 to 47. Average ARMI(e) values were 12\% higher for the AR in relation to the CA. Spatial-temporal comparisons of the ARMI(r) using generalized additive models revealed significant differences between AR and CA. Evaluations of the ARMI(e) scores revealed that the assemblage structure and economic importance level significantly increased over time in the AR. The proposed indices combine structural and functional levels of fish, providing a robust and sensitive method to evaluate the ecological condition of ARs and adjacent areas. The data contribute to discussions related to ARs management and provides a baseline for defining fish assemblage metrics in assessment of localities with artificial structures.",STATE UNIV NORTH RIO DE JANEIRO,"ZALMON, IR (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), STATE UNIV NORTH RIO DE JANEIRO, CTR BIOSCI \& BIOTECHNOL, CAMPOS DOS GOYTACAZES, RJ, BRAZIL",RIO DE JANEIRO STATE FOUNDATION SUPPORT RESEARCH (FAPERJ)FUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ); FAPERJFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ) [E-26/203.002/2016]; NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL -CNPQ [301084/2016-5]; CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES) [001]; COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONNEL (CAPES)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES),

Located 230 km off the NE Brazilian coast, Rocas is formed by coralline red algae and vermetid mollusks, and is potentially one of the most ‚Äúpristine‚Äù areas in Southwestern Atlantic. We provide the first comprehensive and integrative description of the fish and benthic communities inhabiting different shallow reef habitats of Rocas. We studied two contrasting tide pool habitats: open pools, which communicate with the open ocean even during low tides, thus more exposed to wave action; and closed pools, which remain isolated during low tide and are comparatively less exposed. Reef fish assemblages, benthic cover, algal turfs and fish feeding pressure on the benthos remarkably varied between open and closed pools. The planktivore Thalassoma noronhanum was the most abundant fish species in both habitats. In terms of biomass, the lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris and the omnivore Melichtys niger were dominant in open pools, while herbivorous fishes (mainly Acanthurus spp.) prevailed in closed pools. Overall benthic cover was dominated by algal turfs, composed of articulated calcareous algae in open pools and non-calcified algae in closed pools. Feeding pressure was dominated by acanthurids and was 10-fold lower in open pools than in closed pools. Besides different wave exposure conditions, such pattern could also be related to the presence of sharks in open pools, prompting herbivorous fish to feed more in closed pools. This might indirectly affect the structure of reef fish assemblages and benthic communities. The macroalgae Digenea simplex, which is uncommon in closed pools and abundant in the reef flat, was highly preferred in herbivory assays, indicating that herbivory by fishes might be shaping this distribution pattern. The variations in benthic and reef fish communities, and feeding pressure on the benthos between open and closed pools suggest that the dynamics in open pools is mostly driven by physical factors and the tolerance of organisms to harsh conditions, while in closed pools direct and indirect effects of species interactions also play an important role. Understanding the mechanisms shaping biological communities and how they scale-up to ecosystem functioning is particularly important on isolated near-pristine systems where natural processes can still be studied under limited human impact.",UNIV FED SANTA CATARINA,"FLOETER, SR (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED SANTA CATARINA, PROGRAMA POSGRAD ECOL, FLORIANOPOLIS, SC, BRAZIL",CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [563276/2010-0]; FAPESCFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA E INOVACOO ESTADO DE SANTA CATARINA (FAPESC) [6308/2011-8]; CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); BRAZILIAN MINISTRY EDUCATIONAL COUNCIL; CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); PROTAX/CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); PNADB/CAPES,

"LONGO GO, 2020, MAR BIODIVERS",2020,Coral recovery after a burial event: insights on coral resilience in a marginal reef,Coral bleaching; 3D modeling; Siderastrea; Brazil; SW Atlantic,"Scleractinian reef-building corals can lose their endosymbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagelates (Symbiodiniaceae) and bleach in response to drastic changes in environmental conditions, such as extreme temperature fluctuations and burial events. As bleaching episodes are becoming more frequent and intense worldwide, post-bleaching recovery is critical for coral resilience. We report an in situ experiment in which a previously monitored colony of the coral Siderastrea stellata was found detached, overturned, buried, and bleached (95\% of its surface). We reattached the coral to the reef and documented its recovery during 6 months by quantifying its surface area and health condition using 3D models derived from structure-from-motion photogametry of videos obtained in the field. The coral showed the first signs of recovery from a bright-white bleached state within 2 days and fully recovered to a healthy-like state in roughly 1 month, demonstrating that the endosymbiotic algal community recovered fast. Understanding the mechanisms of this fast recovery in marginal reefs in which post-bleaching mortality of dominant reef-building corals like S. stellata is relatively low (< 10\%) may provide insights on how reef-building corals will cope with future climate change",NA,NA,NA,

There are quantitative and qualitative methods that estimate extinction probability based on past sighting records. However, because current baselines about species‚Äô abundances and distributions in the sea were mostly established after humans had started affecting marine populations, researchers must often rely on historical data to elucidate past environmental conditions. We review early historical records from the Archipelago of Saint Paul‚Äôs Rocks, together with data from recent expeditions, with the aim of testing the hypothesis that reef sharks (Carcharhinus spp.) have become extinct there. Our analyses are based on non-parametric probabilistic tests for extinction and on a qualitative framework to examine and judge as objectively as possible the likelihood of local extinction. Until the mid-20th century, visitors to St. Paul‚Äôs Rocks invariably commented on the remarkable number of sharks around the Archipelago. These observations contrast with those of expeditions carried out during the last decade, which report no carcharhinid reef sharks while scuba diving in the archipelago, despite many more hours of underwater fieldwork than previous expeditions. All quantitative and qualitative methods conclude that the reef shark Carcharhinus galapagensis is locally extinct at St. Paul‚Äôs Rocks after a sharp decrease in abundance that took place following the commencement of fishing. However, the persistence of occasional individuals of the once locally common Carcharhinus falciformis in the vicinity of the Archipelago, as a result of constant immigration of this oceanic species from outside the area, suggest that the population might recover if the present fishing pressure was removed.",UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS,"LUIZ, OJ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS, DEPT ZOOL, BR-13083970 CAMPINAS, SP, BRAZIL",CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [135112/2007-9],

Here, we analyse how traits related to the pelagic dispersal and adult biology of 985 tropical reef fish species correlate with their establishing populations on both sides of two Atlantic marine barriers: the Mid-Atlantic Barrier (MAB) and the Amazon‚ÄìOrinoco Plume (AOP). Generalized linear mixed-effects models indicate that predictors for successful barrier crossing are the ability to raft with flotsam for the deep-water MAB, non-reef habitat usage for the freshwater and sediment-rich AOP, and large adult-size and large latitudinal-range for both barriers. Variation in larval-development mode, often thought to be broadly related to larval-dispersal potential, is not a significant predictor in either case. Many more species of greater taxonomic diversity cross the AOP than the MAB. Rafters readily cross both barriers but represent a much smaller proportion of AOP crossers than MAB crossers. Successful establishment after crossing both barriers may be facilitated by broad environmental tolerance associated with large body size and wide latitudinal-range. These results highlight the need to look beyond larval-dispersal potential and assess adult-biology traits when assessing determinants of successful movements across marine barriers.",MACQUARIE UNIV,"LUIZ, OJ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MACQUARIE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, SYDNEY, NSW 2109, AUSTRALIA","INTERNATIONAL MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH EXCELLENCE SCHOLARSHIP; CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); SISBIOTA-MAR [CNPQ 563276/2010-0, FAPESC 6308/2011-8]; CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES",

Species with similar ecomorphological characters have a high potential for competition, especially when close phylogenetically. The diet and resource partitioning of four snappers (Lutjanus alexandrei,L. analis,L. jocuandL. synagris) was studied in the Tubarao River, north-eastern Brazil, between March and November 2012. Specimens were caught using a beach seine, and a total of 731 stomachs were analysed. The highest abundance of snappers was found near to vegetated habitats in the middle estuary. Crustaceans were dominant in the diet of all four species, being found in over 90\% of the stomachs, followed by fish and molluscs. The species did not appear to compete for common resources, probably because there was not always spatial overlap, and differences in the proportions of consumption of items were observed. Ontogenetic comparisons of dietary compositions suggested differences among species, with changes in the diet related to changes in the mouth area as the body size increased. The changes were more evident inL. analisandL. synagriswhere microcrustaceans (Calanoida, Cyclopoida and Amphipoda) were dominant in the diet of the smaller size classes, and benthic crustaceans (Brachyura) and fish in the diet of larger individuals. The intra- and inter-specific differences in the dietary compositions, differences in the mouth area and feeding strategy contribute to allow the co-existence of these snappers in the study area",NA,NA,NA,

With its rapid spread, this coral is now one of the main invasive species in Brazil. Its high invasive capability is related to opportunistic characteristics, including several reproductive strategies that have allowed it to disperse rapidly and widely. To better understand the reproductive biology of T. coccinea and aid in developing management strategies for invaded areas, we investigated aspects of its reproductive performance and life cycle, including the effects of colony size, seawater temperature and salinity, and lunar periodicity on offspring production and larval metamorphosis competence. A total of 18,139 offspring were released in different developmental stages, mainly from the larger colonies, which also produced larvae with longer competence periods. The main reproductive peak occurred during the First Quarter and New Moon phases and was highest in water temperatures around 26 degrees C.

A gap analysis was conducted to evaluate how well marine protected areas (MPAs) in Brazil meet conservation objectives for representation, connectivity, and risk-spreading. The performance of the MPAs was evaluated by overlaying maps of ecosystem and management and calculating the size of no-take areas and the distances between them. All objectives were far from fully attained. Currently, the protection of the marine environment is poor, with less than 1.9% of Brazil‚Äôs marine jurisdiction within MPAs and 0.14% within no-take areas. Also, only 23% of the ecosystems met the minimal number of replicates required by the risk-spreading objective. More positively, just over half (51%) of the no-take areas are a desirable distance apart.

Despite being considered as one of the most important mesophotic reef ecosystems of the South Atlantic, recent criticism on the existence of a living reef in the Amazon River mouth was raised by some scientists and politicians. the region is coveted for large-scale projects for oil and gas exploration. Here, we add to the increasing knowledge about the GARS by exploring evolutionary aspects of the reef using primary and secondary information on radiocarbon dating from carbonate samples. the results obtained demonstrate that the reef is alive and growing, with living organisms inhabiting the GARS in its totality. Additional studies on net reef growth, habitat diversity, and associated biodiversity are urgently needed to help reconcile economic activities and biodiversity conservation.",NA,NA,NA,

They first invaded the tropical rocky reefs at Ilha Grande Bay (southwest Atlantic Ocean), during the early 1990s. Currently, at some Brazilian locations these species occupy 80\% of the benthos of the shallow subtidal. They cause economic and environmental impacts by fouling shipping and modifying native communities. This study provides observations of an additional mechanism of secondary dispersal by T. coccinea and T. tagusensis that were seen attached to floating wood debris and marine litter, which are highly abundant in the region. Such rafting corals have been found adjacent to invaded reefs and stranded on beaches. These observations indicate that transport by rafting over long distances may be another mechanism of range expansion and secondary introduction of these invasive species within the region",UNIV ESTADO RIO DE JANEIRO,"CREED, JC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADO RIO DE JANEIRO, PHLC, DEPT ECOL, LAB ECOL MARINHA BENT,IBRAG, RUA FRANCISCO XAVIER 524,SALA 220, BR-20550900 RIO DE JANEIRO, RJ, BRAZIL","PROGRAMA DE INCENTIVO A PRODUCAO CIENTIFICA, TECNICA E ARTISTICA (PROCIENCIA/UERJ); CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); PETROBRAS THROUGH PETROBRAS ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAM [6000.0054506.09.2]; FUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO/PENSARIO [E-26/010.003031/2014]; INSTITUTO BRASILEIRO DE BIODIVERSIDADE (BRBIO)",

MARCENIUK AP 2013 BIOTA NEOTROP,2013,Knowledge and conservation of the marine and estuarine fishes (Chondrichthyes and Teleostei) of the north coast of Brazil,"biodiversity, inventory, natural resources, zoological collections, Exclusive Economic Zone ","The tropical western South Atlantic, which includes a substantial portion of the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone, is a region of endemism broadly recognized as being of prime importance for the conservation of the marine biodiversity. The north coast of Brazil, which comprises the states of AmapaÃÅ, ParaÃÅ and MaranhaÃÉo from the mouth of the rio Oiapoque to the mouth of the rio ParnaiÃÅba, harbors the largest continuous mangrove in the world, with approximately 8,900 km2. The high discharge of freshwater and continental sediments in the delta of the Amazonas affects the regime of tides, ocean currents, and several oceanographic processes of the north coast, with direct impact on the composition of the biota found in the region. Despite its economic value and intrinsic biological relevance, several aspects of the diversity of the marine and estuarine fishes of the region are poorly known. This situation results mainly from a historical imbalance in terms of the number of studies devoted to increasing the knowledge of the marine biota along the Brazilian coast, such as those dealing with species inventory and taxonomic revisions, which are typically concentrated in the south and southwestern portions of the country. The scientific production focused on marine organisms of the north coast is also imbalanced, and reflects the relatively small number of taxonomists and research groups working on that subject. The insufficient knowledge of the biodiversity of the marine and estuarine fishes of the north coast is an impediment to the implementation of adequate public policies aimed at the management of natural resources in the region. In the long term, that situation is potentially harmful in terms of conservation of a still poorly known biota. A better understanding of the marine fish fauna of the north coast of Brazil will be achieved only through the investment in scientific research and personnel training in systematics and biogeography, coupled with the modernization of the current infrastructure and expansion of scientific collections of the region",AP (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),"MARCENIUK, AP (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MUSCU PARAENSE EMILIO GOELDI, AV GOVERNADOR MAGALHAES BARATA 376, BR-66040170 BELEM, PARA, BRAZIL",NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL OF THE BRAZILIAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ)FUNDACAO DE APOIO A PESQUISA DO DISTRITO FEDERAL (FAPDF) [300462/2016-6]; PARA STATE RESEARCH FOUNDATION (FAPESPA)FUNDACAO AMAZONIA DE AMPARO A ESTUDOS E PESQUISAS (FAPESPA); ICAAF [017/2016],

MARCONI M 2020 OCEAN COASTAL MANAGE,2020,Does quality of scuba diving experience vary according to the context and management regime of marine protected areas,Satisfaction; Conservation; Sustainable tourism; Ecosystem services,"Sustainability of scuba diving tourism should be assessed not only in environmental terms, but also concerning the quality of the diving experiences. Through the application of semi-structured questionnaires, we assessed differences in the scuba diving experiences from three subtropical Brazilian marine protected areas (MPAs) with different contexts and management regimes. We found that MPAs of more restrictive categories attracted mostly divers motivated by their natural attributes. We also found that satisfaction levels were significantly lower in the no-take MPA, where public use planning is stricter. Although we could not replicate the MPAs' contexts, our findings highlight the importance of management strategy as well as the influence of MPA age and socioecological context on scuba diving experiences. In this regard, managers and dive operators are encouraged to assess user characteristics and the context in which the MPA finds itself to plan and develop sustainable tourism",NA,NA,NA,

From these data, it has been possible to define sea-level fluctuation curves for different sectors. Despite these curves being very similar in shape, Ltis possible to observe some differences in amplitude which cannot be fortuitous. The geoid map of Brazil shows that the coastline of the State of Bahia, approximately in the N-S direction, is parallel to the isobases of the geoidal height. In this case, shifts between different sea-level curves are not observed: for instance the 5100 years B.P. maximum is everywhere situated 5.0m above the present level. Otherwise, the coastline of the States of Sao Paulo and Parana, in the NE-SW direction, intercepts the isobases of the geoidal height. In this case, the sea-level curves are clearly shifted: for instance the 5100 years B.P. maximun varies bet~en 4.5 and 2.5m above the present level. The possibility of neotectonic movements being eliminated, it can be deduced that these shifts could have been caused by a deformation9f the present geoid surface.",NA,NA,NA,

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK  WAS TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY ALL THE MACROFAUNA FOUND IN MILLEPORA  ALCICORNIS COLONIES IN THE ``AREA DE PROTECAO ESTADUAL DOS RECIFES DE  CORAL'' RN IN NORTHEAST BRASIL. THE SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED MANUALLY through SCUBA diving, in depths of less than 1 to 3m. The colonies were involved in plastic bags and then extracted from the substratum with the aid of hammer and chisel. Later, the samples were fixed in 4% formalin solution. In the laboratory, the colonies were analyzed to remove the epibiotic fauna and then, carefully broken up for the removal of the boring fauna. A total of 1,234 individuals and 95 species of not-colonials organisms and 86 colonies and 26 species of colonial organisms were registered, belonged to the taxa Cnidaria, Crustacea, Echinodermata, Mollusca, Nemertea, Polychaeta, Porifera, Sipuncula and Tunicata. The crustaceans presented the largest number of individuals and species, followed by Polychaeta and Mollusca. According to the coefficient of Spearman correlation, the number of individuals and species of the not-colonials organisms increase with the growth of the colony. In relation to the colonial fauna, the tunicates had the greatest number of colonies and the sponges the greatest number of species. The epifauna of the colonial and not-colonial groups were more numerous than the infauna. Comparisons between Scleractinia and Milleporidae can be traced because of a possible functional convergence of these taxa. It is possible to assume that the associations with corals do not depend exclusively on the species hostess, as distinct species inhabit the same species of corals in different regions. Probably the substratum had more important function, as its distinct forms promote the formation of habitats.",NA,NA,NA,

However, little is known about the coexistence of these mega-vertebrates and their potential competition for resources. In this work, diet, food selectivity, trophic niche width and niche overlap of juveniles of two sympatric sea turtle species (Eretmochelys imbricata and Chelonia mydas) were evaluated from gastric lavages and habitat surveys in a tropical island bay of the southwestern Atlantic. The main items selected by E. imbricata were the zoanthid Zoanthus sociatus, the sponge Chondrilla nucula and red algae while C. mydas showed strong selectivity for red algae, mainly Asparagopsis sp. Species diets differed significantly and niche overlap was low; E. imbricata's recorded niche was 2.5 times larger than that of C. mydas.

WE INTENDED TO STUDY THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE OCTOPI  FISHERMEN OF COROA VERMELHA USING THE COMPREHENSIVE ETHNOECOLOGICAL  PROPOSAL OF MARQUES. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN JULY 2006 AND  APRIL 2008 THROUGH DIRECT OBSERVATION AND FROM INTERVIEWS WITH  FISHERMEN MET BY CHANCE AND THROUGH THE ``NATIVE SPECIALISTS'' criterion. Twenty semi-structured interviews were carried out following an itinerary of pre-established questions about the activity of octopi capture, and the biological and ecological aspects of the resource. The data showed that the fishermen have knowledge about biological and ecological aspects of the octopi. Two capture techniques are used: octopus fishing (polvejamento) in the reefs and through diving. Two specific folk are recognized: the ""normal octopus"" (Octopus insularis) and the ""east octopus"" (Octopus macropus (?)). The intervieews demonstrated ecological knowledge sometimes compatible with the scientific literature, mainly in which concerns the trophic ecology and behavior of the octopi.",NA,NA,NA,

ONE OF THE OBSERVATIONAL CHALLENGES IN COASTAL REEF  ECOSYSTEMS IS TO QUANTIFY BENTHIC AND CLIMATE INTERACTIONS WHICH ARE KEY  TO COMMUNITY DYNAMICS ACROSS HABITATS. HABITAT COMPLEXITY I.E.  SUBSTRATE RUGOSITY ON INTERTIDAL REEFS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT VARIABLE  EXPLAINING BENTHIC DIVERSITY AND TAXA COMPOSITION BUT THE ASSOCIATION  BETWEEN SUBSTRATE AND SEASONAL VARIABILITY IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD ON  LATERITIC REEFS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC. WE ASKED IF BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES  ON INTERTIDAL REEFS WITH DISTINCT SUBSTRATE RUGOSITY WOULD FOLLOW  SIMILAR SEASONAL PATTERNS OF SUCCESSION FOLLOWING METEO-OCEANOGRAPHIC  VARIABILITY IN A TROPICAL COASTAL AREA OF BRAZIL. WE COMBINED AN  INNOVATIVE 3D IMAGING FOR MEASURING SUBSTRATE RUGOSITY WITH SATELLITE  MONITORING TO MONITOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES.  THE DATASET INCLUDED MONTHLY IN SITU SURVEYS OF SUBSTRATE COVER AND  TAXON DIVERSITY AND RICHNESS TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN  METEO-OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS AND REEF STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY FROM FOUR  SITES ON THE EASTERN MARINE ECOREGION OF BRAZIL. ADDITIONALLY  CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND BOTH BENTHIC DIVERSITY  AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION FROM ONE YEAR OF MONITORING WERE USED TO  PROJECT BIODIVERSITY TRENDS UNDER FUTURE WARMING SCENARIOS. OUR RESULTS  REVEALED THAT BENTHIC DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION ON INTERTIDAL REEFS ARE  STRONGLY REGULATED BY SURFACE RUGOSITY AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES  WHICH CONTROL THE DOMINANCE OF MACROALGAE OR CORALS. INTERTIDAL REEF  BIODIVERSITY WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH REEF RUGOSITY WHICH SUPPORTS  PREVIOUS ASSERTIONS OF HIGHER REGIONAL INTERTIDAL DIVERSITY ON LATERITIC  REEFS THAT OFFER INCREASED SUBSTRATE COMPLEXITY. PREDICTED WARMING  TEMPERATURES IN THE EASTERN MARINE ECOREGION OF BRAZIL WILL LIKELY LEAD  TO A DOMINANCE OF MACROALGAE TAXA OVER THE LATERITIC REEFS AND LOWER  OVERALL BENTHIC DIVERSITY. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT RUGOSITY IS NOT  ONLY A USEFUL TOOL FOR BIODIVERSITY MAPPING IN REEF INTERTIDAL  ECOSYSTEMS BUT ALSO THAT SPATIAL DIFFERENCES IN RUGOSITY WOULD LEAD TO  VERY DISTINCT BIOGEOGRAPHIC AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS.

MIES M 2018 FRONT MAR SCI,2020,South Atlantic Coral Reefs Are Major Global Warming Refugia and Less Susceptible to Bleaching,Brazil; climate change; nutrients; reef-building; resilience; symbiosis; tolerance; turbidity,"Mass coral bleaching has increased in intensity and frequency and has severely impacted shallow tropical reefs worldwide. Although extensive investigation has been conducted on the resistance and resilience of coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean, the unique reefs of the South Atlantic remain largely unassessed. Here we compiled primary and literature data for reefs from three biogeographical regions: Indo-Pacific, Caribbean and South Atlantic and performed comparative analyses to investigate whether the latter may be more resistant to bleaching. Our findings show that South Atlantic corals display critical features that make them less susceptible to mass coral bleaching: (i) deeper bathymetric distribution, as species have a mean maximum depth of occurrence of 70 m; (ii) higher tolerance to turbidity, as nearly 60\% of species are found in turbid conditions; (iii) higher tolerance to nutrient enrichment, as nitrate concentration in the South Atlantic is naturally elevated; (iv) higher morphological resistance, as massive growth forms are dominant and comprise two thirds of species; and (v) more flexible symbiotic associations, as 75\% of corals and 60\% of symbiont phylotypes are generalists. Such features were associated with occurrence of fewer bleaching episodes with coral mortality in the South Atlantic, approximately 60\% less than the Indo-Pacific and 50\% less than the Caribbean. In addition, no mass coral mortality episodes associated with the three global mass bleaching events have been reported for the South Atlantic, which suffered considerably less bleaching. These results show that South Atlantic reefs display several remarkable features for withstanding thermal stress. Together with a historic experience of lower heat stress, our findings may explain why climate change impacts in this region have been less intense. Given the large extension and latitudinal distribution of South Atlantic coral reefs and communities, the region may be recognized as a major refugium and likely to resist climate change impacts more effectively than Indo-Pacific and Caribbean reefs",UNIV SAO PAULO,"MIES, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SAO PAULO, OCEANOG INST, DEPT BIOL OCEANOG, PRACA OCEANOG 191 CIDADE UNIV, BR-05508120 SAO PAULO, SP, BRAZIL",CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [301089/2016-7]; FAPESP/PFPMCG [2010/20350-8]; FAPESPFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP) [2008/54208-0],

We also evaluated the survival of propagules to test whether different levels of aggregation allowed for longer planktonic life and, therefore, higher dispersal potential. Our results show that pelagic polyps live longer than planulae, probably because they can feed and meet the presumably high-energy demands of swimming. Clusters of two or more individuals lived longer than solitary polyps. However, mortality did not differ between small (2‚Äì3 polyps) and large (4‚Äì8 polyps) clusters, suggesting the existence of an upper limit to cluster size. Most swimming clusters (80 %) remained alive after 6 months, suggesting that pelagic metamorphosis and cluster formation can be a key life-history feature increasing dispersal potential, population connectivity, and the colonization of new habitats in this invasive species.",UNIV SAO PAULO,"MIZRAHI, D (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SAO PAULO, CTR BIOL MARINHA CEBIMAR USP, ROD MANOEL HIPOLITO REGO,KM 131-5, BR-11600000 SAO SEBASTIAO, SP, BRAZIL",CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [CNPQ 400614/2014-6]; INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION PROGRAM PC-PEG (PROGRAMA DE ESTUDANTE-CONVENIO DE POS-GRADUACAO); CAPES (COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); FUNDACAO DE APOIO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP)FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP) [2012/0519-3],

WE SAMPLED 19 BRAZILIAN REEFS DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN 3 AND  61 M DEPTH AND TESTED FIVE DRRH PREDICTIONS REGARDING SPECIES DIVERSITY  DISTRIBUTION AND FUNCTIONAL PROFILE OF COMMUNITIES. THE FIRST  PREDICTION WAS THAT DEEP REEFS >30 M DEPTH SHOULD HOST GREATER GAMMA  DIVERSITY TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT SPECIES TO SHALLOW REEFS <30 M. SECOND  DEPTH-GENERALIST SPECIES SHOULD DOMINATE THE SHALLOW REEFS OTHERWISE  LOCAL EXTIRPATION IN SHALLOW AREAS COULD NOT BE REVERTED BY THE DEEP  REEFS. THIRD ALPHA DIVERSITY SHOULD BE GREATER IN DEEP REEFS DUE TO  REDUCED ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURE IN DEEPER AREAS. FOURTH BETA DIVERSITY  SHOULD BE SMALLER AMONG SHALLOW THAN DEEP REEFS DUE TO THE HUMAN-INDUCED  SPREAD OF A FEW DISTURBANCE-ADAPTED SPECIES NEAR SEA SURFACE. FINALLY  THE FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF SHALLOW REEFS SHOULD BE A SUBSET FROM THAT  OF DEEP REEFS TO ALLOW FUNCTIONAL RECOVERING OF SHALLOWER AREAS.  CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS CORAL COMMUNITIES PRESENTED TWICE MORE GAMMA  DIVERSITY IN SHALLOW THAN DEEP REEFS 13 VS. SEVEN EFFECTIVE SPECIES  AND ONLY THREE OUT OF 17 SPECIES OCCURRED ALONG THE ENTIRE GRADIENT.  ADDITIONALLY THE ALPHA DIVERSITY OF RARE TYPICAL AND DOMINANT SPECIES  WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN SHALLOW AND DEEP REEFS AND THE BETA DIVERSITY OF  RARE AND TYPICAL SPECIES WAS ABOUT 50\% GREATER IN SHALLOW THAN DEEP  REEFS. SUPPORTING THE DRRH CORAL COMMUNITIES OF BOTH REEFS WERE  DOMINATED BY REEF-BUILDING ZOOXANTHELLATED GONOCHORIC CORALS WITH  BROODING OR BROADCAST REPRODUCTIVE MODE SIDERASTREA STELLATA AND  MONTASTRAEA CAVERNOSA. HOWEVER SOFT CORALS WERE OBSERVED ONLY IN  SHALLOW REEFS AND AZOOXANTHELLATED CORALS WERE RECORDED ONLY IN DEEP  REEFS. THESE FINDINGS REVEALED A LIMITED POTENTIAL OF DEEP REEFS TO  SERVE AS REFUGES FOR SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC CORAL COMMUNITIES THOUGH  THEY MAY WORK FOR TWO DEPTH-GENERALIST DOMINANT SPECIES.

Species richness is higher than previously reported, but considerable lower than that of the Caribbean region. A specieslarea relationship may explain the lower species richness of the Southwestern Atlantic, besides other historical and ecological factors. Levels of endemism within reef fish families are highly variable (0-loo%), showing a negative association with dispersion capabilities. The wide taxonomic spectrum of fishes bearing Brazilian- endemic species indicates that major cladogenetic events isolated some groups in the southwestern Atlantic. Plio- Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations account for breaking gene flow between the Caribbean and the southwestern Atlantic during regressive periods, but the lack of phylogenetic evidences supporting area relationships complicates biogeographical analyses. Multiple historical factors seem to be responsible for the present composition of the Brazilian reef fish fauna. ",NA,NA,NA,

However, Brazilian reefs have high percentages of endemism (30-50%) concentrated in only 0.4% of the total global reef area, and therefore constitute a conservation priority in the Atlantic Ocean. Immediate attention from scientists and conservationists is urgently needed, since coastal deforestation and coral reef degradation is occurring at extremely high rates.",NA,NA,NA,

MOURA RL 2016 SCI ADV,2016,An extensive reef system at the Amazon River mouth ,MESOPHOTIC DEEP REEF,"Large rivers create major gaps in reef distribution along tropical shelves. The Amazon River represents 20% of the global riverine discharge to the ocean, generating up to a 1.3 √ó 106‚Äìkm2 plume, and extensive muddy bottoms in the equatorial margin of South America. As a result, a wide area of the tropical North Atlantic is heavily affected in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation. Such unfavorable conditions were thought to imprint a major gap in Western Atlantic reefs. We present an extensive carbonate system off the Amazon mouth, underneath the river plume. Significant carbonate sedimentation occurred during lowstand sea level, and still occurs in the outer shelf, resulting in complex hard-bottom topography. A permanent near-bottom wedge of ocean water, together with the seasonal nature of the plume‚Äôs eastward retroflection, conditions the existence of this extensive (~9500 km2) hard-bottom mosaic. The Amazon reefs transition from accretive to erosional structures and en- compass extensive rhodolith beds. Carbonate structures function as a connectivity corridor for wide depth‚Äìranging reef-associated species, being heavily colonized by large sponges and other structure-forming filter feeders that dwell under low light and high levels of particulates. The oxycline between the plume and subplume is associated with chemoautotrophic and anaerobic microbial metabolisms. The system described here provides several insights about the responses of tropical reefs to suboptimal and marginal reef-building conditions, which are accelerating worldwide due to global changes.",UNIV FED RIO DE JANEIRO,"MOURA, RL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED RIO DE JANEIRO, INST BIOL, BR-21941599 RIO DE JANEIRO, RJ, BRAZIL",CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); FAPERJFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ); FAPESFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE ESPIRITU SANTO (FAPES); ANP/BRASOIL,

The mesozooplankton associated with the pelagic realm over the reef formation was characterized, considering the estuarine plume and oceanic influence. Vertical hauls were carried out using a standard plankton net with 200 Œºm mesh size during September 2014. An indicator index was applied to express species importance as ecological indicators in community. Information on functional traits was gathered for the most abundant copepod species. Overall, 179 zooplankton taxa were recorded. Copepods were the richest (92 species), most diverse and most abundant group, whereas meroplankton were rare and less abundant. Species diversity (>3.0 bits.ind-1) and evenness (>0.6) were high, indicating a complex community. Small holoplanktonic species dominated the zooplankton, and the total density varied from 107.98 ind. m-3 over the reef area to 2,609.24 ind. m-3 in the estuarine plume, with a significant difference between coastal and oceanic areas. The most abundant copepods were the coastal species ithona plumifera and Clausocalanus furcatus and early stages copepodites of Paracalanidae. The holoplanktonic Oikopleura, an important producer of mucous houses, was very abundant on the reefs. The indicator species index revealed three groups: (1) indicative of coastal waters under the influence of the estuarine plume [Euterpina acutifrons, Parvocalanus crassirostris, Oikopleura (Vexillaria) dioica and Hydromedusae]; (2) characterized coastal and oceanic conditions (Clausocalanus); (3) characterized the reef system (O. plumifera). Two major copepods functional groups were identified and sorted according to their trophic strategy and coastal-oceanic distribution. The species that dominated the coastal area and the area over the rhodolith beds are indicators of the estuarine plume and are mixed with species of the North Brazil Current. These species practically disappear offshore, where occur oceanic species commonly found in other oligotrophic tropical areas. This ecosystem shows a mixture of estuarine, coastal and oceanic communities coexisting in the waters over the Amazon reefs, with no significant differences among these areas. However, the MDS clearly separated the communities along the salinity gradient in the plume.",UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO,"NEUMANN-LEITAO, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO, DEPT OCEANOG, RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL","CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); COORDENADORIA DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE PERNAMBUCO (FACEPE)FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA DO ESTADO DE PERNAMBUCO (FACEPE); FUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERS); BRAZILIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR TROPICAL MARINE ENVIRONMENTS - INCT AMBTROPIC (CNPQ/FAPESB)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [565054/2010-4, 8936/2011]",

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE WORK WERE TO  IDENTIFY THE SPECIES OF OPHIUROIDEA ASSOCIATED WITH C RIISEI AND TO  VERIFY THE EXISTENCE OF SEASONALITY THROUGH THE DENSITY ABUNDANCE AND  FREQUENCY OF SAMPLED TAXA. DUE TO THE KNOWN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE  OPHIUROIDS AND SPONGES RELATED IN THE LITERATURE THE SPONGES FOUNDED  ASSOCIATED WITH C. RIISEI WERE RECORDED.

IN THIS  SENSE UNDERSTANDING THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF VARIATION IN SPATIAL  PATTERNS OF THE BIOTA IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR DESIGNING EFFECTIVE  CONSERVATION POLICIES. WE INVESTIGATED SPATIAL VARIATION IN FISH  ASSEMBLAGES AROUND THE WINDWARD AND LEEWARD SIDES OF COASTAL ISLANDS  SITUATED ACROSS A GRADIENT OF RIVERINE INFLUENCE 13 KM IN LENGTH.  SPECIFICALLY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ROCKY REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES AND  BENTHIC TOPOGRAPHIC AND PHYSICAL PREDICTORS WERE ASSESSED. WE  HYPOTHESIZED THAT RIVER INDUCED DISTURBANCES MAY OVERCOME LOCAL HABITAT  FEATURES IN MODELING SPATIAL PATTERNS OF FISH DISTRIBUTION. FISH  ASSEMBLAGES VARIED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRONG DIRECTIONAL GRADIENT OF  RIVERINE INFLUENCE 22.6\% OF THE ESTIMATED COMPONENTS OF VARIATION  FOLLOWED BY TOPOGRAPHIC COMPLEXITY 15\% WAVE EXPOSURE 9.9\% AND  BENTHIC COVER 8\%. THE TROPHIC STRUCTURE OF FISH ASSEMBLAGES CHANGED  FROM HAVING A HIGH ABUNDANCE OF INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS IN  MACROALGAE-DOMINATED REEFS CLOSE TO RIVER MOUTHS TO A HIGH PROPORTION OF  HERBIVORES PLANKTIVORES AND INVERTEBRATE FEEDER SPECIES IN REEFS WITH  LARGE BOULDERS COVERED BY EPILITHIC ALGAL MATRICES AS THE DISTANCE FROM  RIVERS INCREASED. THIS GRADIENT LED TO AN INCREASE OF 4.5-FOLD IN FISH  RICHNESS AND FISH TROPHIC GROUP DIVERSITY 11-FOLD IN FISH BIOMASS AND  10-FOLD IN FISH ABUNDANCE. OUR RESULTS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE  CONSERVATION AND MONITORING OF ASSEMBLAGES PATCHILY DISTRIBUTED AT SMALL  SPATIAL SCALES.

THE RICHNESS AND DENSITY  OF CRUSTACEANS DIFFERED AMONG CORAL SPECIES AND CAGE TREATMENTS EXCEPT  BETWEEN PARTIAL CAGE AND NO CAGE TREATMENT. MUSSISMILIA HARTTII SHOWED  HIGHER RICHNESS AND DENSITY IN UNCAGED AND PARTIAL CAGE TREATMENTS  COMPARED WITH M. BRAZILIENSIS WHICH IN TURN SHOWED HIGHER VALUES THAN  M. HISPIDA.

Two different processes may modulate fish antipredator behavior in the waters off remote archipelagos. First, places with low human density may have reduced fishing pressure. Second, due to their remoteness and lack of other human impacts, these isolated places may have more intact fish assemblages. We investigated antipredator behavior off the smallest archipelago in the Equatorial Atlantic not subjected to regular spearfishing by quantifying flight initiation distance (FID) ‚Äï the distance a diver can approach a fish before it flees. Our goal was to identify natural patterns of risk assessment in reef fish. We focused on five common species and investigated how body size, group size and depth influence on the FID. In contrast to previous studies, we found that Caranx lugubris had significantly negative relationships between body size and FID, whereas Kyphosus sectatrix showed an opposite relationship. Finally, only a single species (Melichthys niger) had a significant relationship between depth and FID. Given we found small FID for all species studied, we suggest that much of our understanding of fish antipredator behavior studied using FID may reflect the somewhat ubiquitous impact of humans on species‚Äô risk assessments and not reflect patterns seen in areas with very low human density/disturbance. Our results suggest that fish antipredator behavior may be a metric of human impacts.",UNIV FED BAHIA,"NUNES, JDCC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED BAHIA, PROGRAMA POSGRAD ECOL \& BIOMONITORAMENTO, RUA BARAO GEREMOABO S-N, BR-40170000 SALVADOR, BA, BRAZIL","CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); FAPESBFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DA BAHIA (FAPESB); CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [303897/2011-2, 239978/2012-9]",

OLIVEIRA 1995 BOL TEC CIENT CEPENE,1995,BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES IN THE ST PETER AND ST PAUL ARCHIPELAGO,,"The fishing activities on the Archipelago of Saint Peter and Saint Paul started in the late 55 ÃÅN, by the japanese fleet under a fishing agreement, with the Brazilian government. Four years later these activities were suspended, and Brazilian vessels started to fish in the area much later, in 1976, with the diversification of the lobster fishing fleet. In 1977, IBAMA (as former SUDEPE) started to develop research in the area, with visits distributed in two periods: 1977 to 1978 and 1985 to 1986. From 1992 to 1995, CEPENE (IBAMA) and the UFRPE started a joint research program to study the highly migratory fish stocks in the area. The first records about the fish fauna of this Archipelago were published by Delano in 1817. Since then, several research expeditions have visited the Archipelago, including Herwire in 1832. In 1979, an expedition from the Cambridge University, England, visited the rocks and collected material. Subsequently, a list with 50 species of fish, including four endemic species, was published. The abundance of resources was reported in most expeditions. During the expedition of RV CANOPUS (Brazilian Navy) limited fish collection was conducted and 16 species of fish and one of crustacean were identified. The present paper analyses the available information about the biology and fisheries in the Saint Peter and Saint Paul ÃÅs Archipelago, and offers suggestions about the participation of CEPENE and UFPE in the research projects to be implemented in the area.",NA,NA,NA,
OLIVEIRA 2012 ICRS12,2012,Recording Reefs with Darwinian Questions: Historical Studies on the Brazilian Northeast Coast,Darwinism  Biogeography Biogeography  Natural barriers,"The objective of this research is to gather empirical information to emphasize the insertion of the Northeast Coast of Brazil into the North-American Darwinian discussion, especially the zoology of its coral reefs. References on subject are found in descriptions produced by the Stanford Expedition to Brazil, 1911. The Expedition was directed by John Branner, geologist who worked for a long time with David Jordan, zoologist at Stanford. They worked with models of speciation of species and their scientific practices included a variety of methods of natural sciences: biogeographic records, systematic taxonomy (distribution laws), ecological perspectives and collaborative research (biology and geology). This expedition recorded the biogeography of the marine life to understand the role of the isolation on the divergence of species characteristics separated by a natural barrier. The taxonomy developed by these studies involves a knowledge that has acted as a bridge between the old-fashioned natural history and a modern field system. This kind of fieldwork integrated the descriptive activity with qualitative models. Today, the results of the Expedition are reflected in many scientific institutions in North America including biological collections and bibliographies. These indications are important biological records about the Brazilian reefs and they are indicative of the relevant scientific Darwinian work made by this Expedition in a period of the ‚Äúeclipse‚Äù of the Darwinian Theory. Thus, we attempt to analyze all these references as a whole, placing emphasis on both the practical science and the history documented in the records of Brazilian coral reefs. ",NA,NA,NA,

OLIVEIRA UDR 2019 PLOS ONE,2019,Modeling impacts of climate change on the potential habitat of an endangered Brazilian endemic coral: Discussion about deep sea refugia ,MESOPHOTIC DEEP REEF,"Climate and environmental conditions are determinant for coral distribution and their very existence. When changes in such conditions occur, their effects on distribution can be predicted through species distribution models, anticipating suitable habitats for the subsistence of species. Mussismilia harttii is one of the most endangered Brazilian endemic reef-building corals, and in increasing risk of extinction. Herein, species distribution models were used to determine the present and future potential habitats for M. harttii. Estimations were made through the maximum entropy approach, predicting suitable habitat losses and gains by the end of the 21st century. For this purpose, species records published in the last 20 years and current and future environmental variables were correlated. The best models were chosen according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and evaluated through the partial ROC (AUCratio), a new approach which uses independent occurrence data. Both approaches showed that the models performed satisfactorily in predicting potential habitat areas for the species. Future projections were made using the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for 2100, with different levels of greenhouse gas emission. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used to model the Future Potential Habitat (FPH) of M. harttii in two different scenarios: stabilization of emissions (RCP 4.5) and increase of emissions (RCP 8.5). According to the results, shallow waters to the south of the study area concentrate most of the current potential habitats for the species. However, in future scenarios, there was a loss of suitable areas in relation to the Current Potential Habitat (RCP 4.5 46% and RCP 8.5 59%), whereas there is a southward shift of the suitable areas. In all scenarios of FPH, the temperature was the variable with the greatest contribution to the models (> 35%), followed by the current velocity (> 33%) and bathymetry (>29%). In contrast, there is an increase of deep (50‚Äì75 m) suitable areas FPH scenarios, mainly in the southern portion of its distribution, at Abrolhos Bank (off Espirito Santo State). These deeper sites might serve as refugia for the species in global warming scenarios. Coral communities at such depths would be less susceptible to impacts of climate change on temperature and salinity However, the deep sea is not free from human impacts and measures to protect deeper ecosystems should be prioritized in environmental policies for Brazilian marine conservation, especially the Abrolhos Bank, due to its importance for M. harttii. mesophotic deep reef",NA,NA,NA,

THE MAIN IMPACT IS A REDUCTION IN THE  LUMINOSITY AVAILABLE FOR PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY WHICH IS DIRECTLY  RELATED TO A DECREASE IN THE BIOMASSES OF SEDIMENT MICROPHYTOBENTHOS AND  OF MORE HIGHLY STRUCTURED MACROALGAE LIFE-FORMS. CONTRARY TO  EXPECTATIONS THE MORPHOTYPES OF POTENTIALLY HIGH BIOMASS PRODUCTIVITY  SUCH AS ARTICULATED CORALLINE CORTICATED AND LEATHERY MACROALGAE WERE  IN GENERAL LESS ABUNDANT AND THE LOW BIOMASS FOLIOSE AND FILAMENTOUS  MACROALGAE OCCURRED IN REFERENCE AREAS BUT NOT UNDER THE PIERS.

ARTIFICIAL SHADING HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AS AN IMPORTANT HUMAN  DISTURBANCE AFFECTING BOTH PRODUCTIVITY AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION.  HOWEVER STUDIES OF SHADING HAVE BEEN POORLY EXPLORED FROM AN  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PERSPECTIVE.  2. WE COMPARED COMMUNITY STRUCTURE ON SUBTROPICAL ROCKY SHORES IN AREAS  SHADED BY HUMAN CONSTRUCTIONS WITH THOSE IN UNSHADED AREAS. WE THEN  IMPLEMENTED A MANIPULATIVE FIELD EXPERIMENT TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF  SHADING ON THE MACROBENTHIC COMMUNITY BIOFILM BIOMASS AND LARVAL  RECRUITMENT.  3. SHADING CONSISTENTLY AFFECTED THE BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITY OF ROCKY  SHORES. THE BIOMASS AND COVER OF MACROALGAE AND THE SIZE OF MOST  SEDENTARY GRAZERS WERE SMALLER IN SHADED HABITAT. IN THE INFRALITTORAL  FRINGE WE RECORDED A SHIFT IN DOMINANCE FROM MACROALGAE IN UNSHADED  HABITATS TO INVERTEBRATE FILTER FEEDERS IN SHADED ONES. IN A SIMILAR  WAY THE COMMUNITY FROM THE MESOLITTORAL WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY SHADING  BUT NOT AT ALL LOCATIONS.  4. EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION OF SHADING LED TO A TOTAL LOSS OF  MACROALGAE FROM THE INFRALITTORAL FRINGE AND NO COMMUNITY REPLACEMENT  OVER A PERIOD OF 220 DAYS.

Fish assemblages in tide pools are usually very different from those in surrounding areas; resident species exhibit morphological and ecological adaptations to deal with such a variable environment. In this study, we described the environmental conditions and the fish diversity and composition from four tide pools at the continental margin of the SaÃÉo SebastiaÃÉo Channel, SaÃÉo SebastiaÃÉo (23o41‚Äô- 23o54‚ÄôS; 45o19‚Äô-45o30‚ÄôW), in southeastern Brazil. Monthly, from January to December 2011, we sampled four tide pools (12 samples per pool), applying a standard protocol to record environmental variables, and visual censuses to record abundance, richness and composition of fish assemblages. Environmental and fish data were compared among tide pools and periods throughout the year (warm and cold) using both univariate and multivariate analyses of variance. Tide pools showed significant environmental differences, mainly in area, volume and complexity of substrata. We observed 13 species of fishes (10 families), which belong to five trophic guilds (roving herbivores, territorial herbivores, mobile invertebrate feeders, omnivores and carnivores). Density and richness of fish were almost constant during the studied period, except for a reduction in fish density in SaÃÉo Francisco‚Äôs Beach during a cold period. However, assemblages from the sampled tide pools differed from each other in composition and relative abundance of species, resulting in four distinct assemblage structures. Bathygobius soporator was the dominant species in most of the tide pools, corresponding to 66% of all recorded fish. The tide pool from Baleeiro‚Äôs Point was intermediate in size, but was covered by a complex algae community and supported the most diverse fish assemblage, suggesting that habitat complexity may contribute to the diversity of fish.",UNIV FED ABC,"GIBRAN, FZ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED ABC, CTR CIENCIAS NAT \& HUMANAS, RUA ARCTURUS 03,BLOCO DELTA, BR-09606070 SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, SP, BRAZIL",SAO PAULO RESEARCH FOUNDATION (FAPESP)FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP) [2013/11286-2]; UFABC; CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [302399/2016-0],

THE ABUNDANCE OF TUBASTRAEA WAS QUANTIFIED BY DEPTH USING THREE DIFFERENT SAMPLING METHODS COLONY DENSITY VISUAL ESTIMATION AND INTERCEPT POINTS 100 FOR PERCENTAGE OF COVER. TUBASTRAEA SHOWED AMPLE TOLERANCE TO TEMPERATURE AND DESICCATION SINCE IT WAS FOUND MORE ABUNDANTLY IN VERY SHALLOW WATERS 0.1-0.5 M DESPITE THE FACT THAT HARD SUBSTRATUM IS AVAILABLE AT GREATER DEPTHS AT ALL THE STATIONS SAMPLED. AT MOST SITES 1 TO 5 COLONIES PER 0.25 M2 WERE FOUND MOST FREQUENTLY BUT OCCASIONALLY MORE THAN 50 COLONIES WERE FOUND PER 0.25 M2 INDICATING A SOMEWHAT GREGARIOUS SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION FOR THIS CORAL. THE CORAL TUBASTRAEA WAS FOUND TO OCCUPY SLOPES OF EVERY POSSIBLE ANGLE IN THE CANAL CENTRAL OF ILHA GRANDE BUT MORE COLONIES WERE FOUND OCCUPYING SLOPES OF 80 TO 100 DEGREES.

Our results indicate that a significant part of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) identified were able to survive the transition from freshwater to seawater, several of them belonging to genera implicated in human pathogenesis. The BBC:A ratio and functional prediction suggests that both study rivers are subject to fecal contamination and xenobiotics input and that the bacterial communities were more homogeneous in these environments.

We then examined settlement and larval enzymatic activity. No differences in settlement were detected among salinities. Settlement was also similar to control for larvae under 100\% river water. Enzymatic activity for citrate synthase remained unaltered for all treatments. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was slightly altered under different salinities, suggesting a mild stress response. Findings suggest that F. gravida larvae are tolerant to a wide range of salinity and nutrient conditions and that this is a stress-tolerant species",NA,NA,NA,

SP. WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN NA,"The type species of Tanacetipathes Opresko, 2001 is Antipathes tanacetum PourtaleÃÄs, 1880. Pour- taleÃÄs did not designate a holotype for A. tanacetum, nor did he indicate which form he thought was the most ‚Äútypical‚Äù of the species. Because of the similarities of some of the syntypes with other nominal species, it is necessary to select a lectotype from one of the two groups with predominantly uniserial pinnulation. A specimen with short curved primary pinnules was chosen because it has a very distinctive pinnulation pattern that has been previously associated with Tanacetipathes tanace- tum. With a lectotype of T. tanacetum designated, potential new species of Tanacetipathes can now be evaluated and compared directly with the type species. This is the case for T. paula n. sp., which is described here from the littoral of Archipelago of Saint Peter and Saint Paul (Brazil). This species has a corallum pseudo-dichotomously branched, with primary pinnules arranged in four rows and in alternating biserial groups of two pinnules each. The primary pinnules are up to 1.9 cm in length. The secondary pinnules usually occur bilaterally, on both sides of the primary pinnules, and often in subopposite pairs, especially near the base of the primary pinnules. There are usually 3-9 second- ary pinnules per lateral primary pinnules. The anterior primary pinnules always with only two sec- ondary pinnules arranged in subopposite pair nearer the base of primary.

The species with the widest distribution,Hypanus americanus(Hildebrand and Schroeder, 1928), from the northeastern coast of the United States to southeastern Brazil, was demonstrated to be paraphyletic based on protein-coding mitochondrial genome analyses. This data set also indicates that the genetic distance between the new species Hypanus berthalutzae sp. nov.and its three closely related species (H. americanus,H.longusandH.rudis) varies from 0.82\% to 3.14\%. In addition, Bayesian Analysis of Population Similarity using the mitochondrial genemt-nd2supports the separation ofH. berthalutzaesp. nov.(southwestern Atlantic) from its sister speciesH. rudis(eastern Atlantic). Similarly, morphological and morphometric analyses corroborated four morphotypes within theH. americanus species group and indicated the ventral caudal fold height and length and interspiracular and interorbital lengths as useful measurements to distinguish among them. Claspers of adult males also exhibit morphological differences among species. The ENM agreed with molecular and morphological analyses and delimits the distribution ofH. berthalutzaesp. nov.to shallow areas close to shore along the Brazilian coast, from the mouth of the Amazon River to Sao Paulo State, including the northeastern oceanic islands, suggesting that the great outflow of fresh water and sediments and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge might act as barriers.

UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS  OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF NATURAL  COMMUNITIES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS FOR  BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION. HOWEVER THE EFFECTS OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION  ON MARINE COMMUNITIES ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HERE WE EVALUATED  WHETHER HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AFFECTS THE STRUCTURE OF EPIFAUNAL  COMMUNITIES IN THE SUBLITTORAL ZONE IN THE NORTHERN COAST OF SO PAULO  STATE BRAZIL. FIVE EXPERIMENTAL LANDSCAPES WERE CONSTRUCTED EACH ONE  FORMING A LARGE CONTINUOUS PATCH. AFTER 4 WEEKS EACH LANDSCAPE WAS CUT  ON THREE PATCHES OF DIFFERENT SIZES. EPIFAUNAL MACROINVERTEBRATE  COMMUNITIES WERE SAMPLED AT THE EDGE AND INTERIOR OF EXPERIMENTAL  LANDSCAPES BEFORE MANIPULATION TO EVALUATE EDGE EFFECTS. AFTER FOUR MORE  WEEKS COMMUNITIES FROM THE THREE PATCH SIZES WERE ALSO SAMPLED TO  EVALUATE PATCH SIZE EFFECTS. WE COMPARED THE DIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES AT  DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FRAGMENTATION BY TOTAL ABUNDANCE RAREFIED TAXON  RICHNESS SHANNON-WIENER DIVERSITY INDEX SIMPSON'S DOMINANCE INDEX AND  ABUNDANCE OF DOMINANT TAXA. HIGHER TAXON RICHNESS AND GASTROPOD  ABUNDANCE WERE RECORDED IN THE PATCH EDGES BUT NO SIGNIFICANT  DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND AMONG PATCH SIZES.

LOWER ABUNDANCES OF DOMINANT TAXA RESULTED IN HIGHER  DIVERSITY AND LOWER DOMINANCE IN FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES WHEN COMPARED TO  INTEGRAL PRE-MANIPULATION LANDSCAPES.

South‚Äêwestern Atlantic (SWA ): Brazilian and Argentinian Provinces. A database composed of 733 fish species along 23 locations in the SWA (00¬∞55‚Ä≤ N to 43¬∞00‚Ä≤ S) was compiled based on primary data, literature and museum records. Cluster and beta diversity analyses were carried out to evaluate faunal overlaps among locations and subprovinces. ‚ÄúTarget‚Äêarea‚Äêdistance effect‚Äù and ‚Äústepping stones dispersal‚Äù hypotheses for assemblage composition were tested through Mantel tests. Relationships between the distribution patterns and ecological traits of reef fish species were investigated through generalized linear mixed‚Äêeffect models. Out of the 733 fish species, 405 are SWA resident reef fishes, of which 111 (27%) are endemics and 78 are threatened with extinction. Cluster analysis detected six subprovinces in the SWA structured following the target‚Äêarea‚Äêdistance model, and with no evidence for a latitudinal gradient in diversity. The greatest overall richness and endemic species richness were found in the east‚Äìsouth‚Äêeastern region. Depth range, habitat use and body size were the main drivers of SWA reef fish assemblage structure. The Brazilian and Argentinian coasts constitute different provinces structured by oceanographic barriers and environmental filters. Similarities among oceanic islands indicate connectivity driven by stochastic and ecological factors. Species richness and endemism indicate that peripheral provinces may also bear centres of origin and biodiversity, patterns driven by parapatric/ecological speciation and the overlap between tropical and subtropical reef fish species. Ecological drivers of reef fish distribution, such as habitat specialization and body size, support hypotheses of speciation in the periphery. New approaches for spatial planning, marine protected areas and off‚Äêreserve marine management are essential for the conservation and sustainability of SWA reef fishes.",UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ,"PINHEIRO, HT (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF SANTA CRUZ, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, SANTA CRUZ, CA 95064 USA",FUNDACAO O BOTICARIO DE PROTECAO A NATUREZA [0643-20042]; CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); ASM [305350/2009-9],

SPSPA has low species richness and high endemism; nonetheless, the diversity of fishes from deep habitats (>30 m depth) had not been previously studied in detail. Several expeditions conducted between 2009 and 2018 explored the shallow and deep reefs of SPSPA using scuba, closed-circuit rebreathers, manned submersibles, baited remote underwater stereo-videos (stereo-BRUV) and fishing between 0 and 1050 m depth. These expeditions yielded 41 new records of fishes for SPSPA: 9 in open waters, 9 in shallow waters (0-30 m), 8 in mesophotic ecosystems (30-150 m) and 15 in deeper reefs (>150 m). Combined with literature records of adult pelagic, shallow and deep-reef species, as well as larvae, the database of the fish biodiversity for SPSPA currently comprises 225 species (169 recorded as adult fishes and 79 as larvae, with 23 species found in both stages). Most of them (112) are pelagic, 86 are reef-associated species and 27 are deep-water specialists. Species accumulation curves show that the number of fish species has not yet reached an asymptote. Whereas the number of species recorded in SPSPA is similar to that in other oceanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the proportion of shorefishes is relatively lower, and the endemism level is the third highest in the Atlantic. Twenty-nine species are listed as threatened with extinction. Observations confirm the paucity of top predators on shallow rocky reefs of the island, despite the presence of several pelagic shark species around SPSPA. Because all of the endemic species are reef associated, it is argued that the new marine-protected areas created by the Brazilian government do not ensure the protection and recovery of SPSPA's biodiversity because they allow exploitation of the most vulnerable species around the archipelago itself. This study suggests a ban on reef fish exploitation inside an area delimited by the 1000 m isobath around the islands (where all known endemics are concentrated) as the main conservation strategy to be included in the SPSPA management plan being prepared by the Brazilian government",CALIF ACAD SCI,"PINHEIRO, HT (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CALIF ACAD SCI, 55 MUS CONCOURSE DR,GOLDEN GATE PK, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94118 USA",RESEARCH PROGRAMME ``PROGRAMA DE MONITORAMENTO DE LONGA DURACAO DAS COMUNIDADES RECIFAIS DE ILHAS OCEANICAS - PELD ILOC'' (CNPQ) [441241/2016-6]; CAPES - CIMAR II; CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES' HOPE FOR REEFS INITIATIVE,

The study sites lie within the most diverse coral reef area in the South Atlantic. Transects were 20 10 long but 10 10 is shown to be adequate for the study area. The average diversity indices for sites surveyed on both islands were low (H'c 0.57 + 0.12), due to a very high relative dominance -and a relatively small number of species. The living coverage in the transects ranges from 10% to 30%. This area under study quantitative data on the required to allow future fragility. The species distribution on both reefs, does not show any nitid zonation pattern; a ""Millepora zone"", as described by Laborel in the 1960's, was not found. Two species (Mussismilia braziliensis and Siderastres stellata) are dominant in all transects. This study has as objectives: a) to describe quantitatively the zonation pattern and species diversity in two fringing reefs (Fig. 1) located in islands in the Abrolhos Archipelago - Santa Barbara and Siriba Islands; and b) to compare our data with those obtained by Laborel (1969). Laborel (1969) did a qualitative study on the ecology of coral populations off the Brazilian coast, including exactly the same sites now under study. Since this contribution, no other study has dealt with this subject up to now, using either qualitative Or quantitative methods. The use of relative living coverage together with the number of colonies is recommended for future works in this area, due to high variation in colony sizes ",NA,NA,NA,

Along the northeast and north parts of the coast, warm currents give support to a great variety of ecosystems including mangroves, coral reefs, dunes, sandbanks, sandy beaches, islands, lagoons and estuaries. Coral reefs, in Brazil are distributed along 3,000 km of the northeastern coast as the only reef ecosystem in the South Atlantic. Nine MPAs have been created over coral reef ecosystems, and several other measures have been taken in order protect coral reefs, including a significant number of conventions, laws, norms and procedures. Brazil was the first country to sign the Convention of the Biological Diversity and this commitment has stimulated a series of conservation measures. In this context, the Law of Environmental Crimes and the Law of the National System of Conservation Units were of special significance. In addition, the Ministry of the Environment in partnership with other institutions has created a number of programs. Some examples are the ‚ÄôAtlas of Coral Reef Protected Areas in Brazil‚Äô, the Coral Reefs Conservation Campaign and the Brazilian Coral Reef Monitoring Program. This paper will bring together the main strategies established for the conservation of coral reefs in Brazil, and describe the legal instruments and the most relevant programs aimed to the conservation as well as the threats to their success.",NA,NA,NA,

In the first phase of the Campaign, managers of nine protected areas established in coral reef sites were invited to be partners. In 2005, with the financial support of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, environmental training courses were developed targeting the five most visited Brazilian beaches with coral reefs (Maracajau, Jo√£o Pessoa, Porto de Galinhas, Tamandar√© and Porto Seguro). Various outreach materials were prepared: posters, folders, textbooks, stickers, t-shirts, caps and DVD-videos.

To support managers decision making in the Alagoas coast, the present study intended to determine the existence of interactions between physical and operational characteristics of the fishing fleet and the marine ichthyofauna exploited in northeast Brazil. From May, 2007 to April, 2008, interviews with fishermen were conducted based using structured and unstructured questionnaires. There were recorded and mapped 59 fishing grounds that has been exploited both by gillnet boats (""caceia"") and line-fishing vessels. Four of these fishing grounds stand out due to the high frequency of use, but also there were indicated as key fishing grounds. We identified and classified 99 fish species into three categories: reef, estuarine and epipelagic. Two fishing strategies were identified within the area of operation of the fleet studied: coastal fishing and slope fishing. This study revealed a close relationship between the spatial distribution of the fleet, exploited species, fishing gears, fish yield and value. The result was a categorization of the fishing area.

OBSERVED FAIRLY CONTINUOUS AND SINUOUS MID-OUTER SHELF  ESCARPMENTS ARE RELATED TO THE SEA-LEVEL VARIATIONS AND SHELF EXPOSURE  DURING THE LAST GLACIAL CYCLE. A BATHYMETRIC STEP AT -110 M IS AN  EROSIONAL REMNANT OF OFFLAPPING DETACHED FORCED-REGRESSIVE WEDGES THAT  SPREAD OVER 50 KM IN THE SHELF-DIP DIRECTION PROBABLY DEVELOPED DURING  PERIODS OF FALLING SEA LEVEL BETWEEN MIS 3 AND 2. A SECOND MAJOR  ESCARPMENT AT -130 M WAS INTERPRETED AS THE SHORELINE DURING THE LGM AT  THE TIME OF MOST EXTENSIVE SUBAERIAL EXPOSURE OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF.  HOWEVER A DISTAL ESCARPMENT AT -150 M IS EXPRESSED AS A STRAIGHT  CONTOUR FEATURE ALONG THE TWO MAIN SHELF-EDGE EMBAYMENTS THAT  CHARACTERIZE THE SHELF BREAK. THIS ESCARPMENT IS COUPLED WITH A BASAL  SEAWARD-INCLINED AND HIGHLY ERODED RAMP AND WAS INTERPRETED AS THE  EROSIONAL ACTION OF BOTTOM CURRENTS DURING THE LAST TRANSGRESSION DUE TO  THE DISPLACEMENT OF THE SOUTHWARD FLOWING BRAZIL CURRENT TOWARDS THE  PRESENT-DAY OUTER SHELF. PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED ARTICLES HAVE REGARDED THE  MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES OBSERVED ON THE MODERN SHELF AS INDICATORS OF  STILLSTANDS DURING THE POST-LGM TRANSGRESSION.

The scarcity of such information may be the result of the difficulty in sampling these habitats in meso- and macrotidal areas. Here, we attempted to gain a thorough understanding of fish cross-habitat movements and their migration patterns along tidal cycles by characterizing the structural roles that different mangrove microhabitats (e.g. forest and adjacent estuarine habitat) may have on fish assemblages. To achieve this, we placed underwater wide-angle cameras at different positions within the mangrove ecotone and sampled along entire tidal cycles within 15 mangrove habitats located along the Brazilian central coast. Our results showed that sequential patterns of fish occupancy (i.e. identity, diversity and abundance) were coupled to microhabitat characteristics, and those were contingent on the prevalent tidal stages. We observed clear species-specific associations forming distinct subassemblages along a tidal cycle. Mangrove edges, rather than any other habitat types, were pathways of fish migration. Our results revealed that, as a whole, the mangrove ecotone is used by the entire fish assemblage and that tidal cycles lead to sequential microhabitats use having strong structuring roles and leading to predictable subassemblages recombination. Such distinct ‚Äúassemblage-microhabitat‚Äù couplings along tidal cycles highlight important interactive effects that these variables may have on migratory and fish behavioural patterns. Overall, we highlight that within mangroves, the benefits that fish receive from sequential microhabitat are highly context dependant and clearly reflect tidal effects.",NA,NA,NA,

HERE WE  ANALYSED THE STRUCTURAL AND TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF A TIDAL CYCLE AND  MANGROVE FISH ASSEMBLAGES AT 15 SITES ALONG THE BRAZILIAN CENTRAL COAST.  SPECIFICALLY WE USED TWO NON-EXTRACTIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUES WHICH  INCLUDED STATIONARY UNDERWATER VISUAL CENSUS S-UVC AND STATIONARY  UNDERWATER WIDE-CAMERA CENSUS S-UWC. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT BY  REDUCING POTENTIAL OBSERVER EFFECTS THE S-UWC PROTOCOL MAXIMIZED FISH  COUNTS YIELDING MORE ACCURATE AND PRECISE ESTIMATES.

FURTHERMORE THE METHODS WERE MORE SIMILAR FOR THE HIGH TIDE SAMPLES AND  MORE DIVERGENT FOR THE FLOOD TIDE AND EBB TIDE SAMPLES.

SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE ACOUSTICALLY  MAPPED RHODOLITH BEDS AS A HOMOGENEOUS HABITAT BUT SPATIAL CHANGES IN  NODULE COVERAGE OR DENSITY COMMONLY OCCUR. HERE THE OBJECTIVE IS TO  ACOUSTICALLY RECOGNIZE HETEROGENEITIES IN RHODOLITH BED STRUCTURE USING  THE RESPONSE OF BACKSCATTER TO MAP CHANGES IN NODULE COVERAGE AND  DENSITY. HIGH-RESOLUTION MULTIBEAM SONAR MBSS DATA WERE ACQUIRED ON  APRIL 2018 IN THE MARINE PROTECTION AREA MPA COSTAS DAS ALGAS  LOCATED IN THE ESPIRITO SANTO CONTINENTAL SHELF EASTERN BRAZILIAN  COAST. THREE AREAS WERE SELECTED BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA TOTALIZING  73KM2 OF DATA ACQUISITION. GROUND TRUTH WAS OBTAINED AT 80 STATIONS  USING A DROP CAMERA SYSTEM. SEABED CLASSIFICATION WAS DETERMINED BY  APPLYING AN IMAGE SEGMENTATION PROCESS ON MULTIBEAM SONAR BACKSCATTER  MOSAIC. GROUND TRUTH DATA WAS USED TO STATISTICALLY SHOW THE RELATION  BETWEEN BACKSCATTER AND SEABED TYPES. RESULTS IDENTIFIED THREE CLASSES  RELATED TO RHODOLITHS IN DIFFERENT COVERAGE DENSITIES LOW RHODOLITH  COVERAGE INFERIOR TO 25\% OF RHODOLITHS OVER A DETERMINED AREA  MODERATE RHODOLITH COVERAGE BETWEEN 25\% AND 35\% OF RHODOLITHS AND  HIGH RHODOLITH COVERAGE > 35\%. CLASSES ASSOCIATED WITH SEDIMENT  BIOCONCRETIONS AND RED ALGAE GENUS PEYSSONELIAS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED. A  MAP SHOWING CHANGES IN RHODOLITH COVERAGE ACROSS THE SHELF DEPTH  GRADIENT WERE PRODUCED. THE SEABED CLASSES HAD A STATISTICALLY  SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH THE SEGMENTED BACKSCATTER CLASSES. IN  GENERAL HIGHER RHODOLITH COVERAGE CORRELATES WITH HIGHER BACKSCATTER.  THE BACKSCATTER MOSAIC OVER THE AREA IS MARKED BY AN EXTENSIVE PRESENCE  OF THE RED ALGAE PEYSSONELIAS RESULTING IN A LOWER CORRELATION INDEX  WHEN COMPARED TO THE AREAS WITH NO PEYSSONELIA.

SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS WERE ANALYSED BASED ON LITERATURE  RECORDS AND MATERIAL DEPOSITED AT BRAZILIAN AND AMERICAN COLLECTIONS.  RESULTS RECENT ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT ABOUT 12\% OF THE BRAZILIAN REEF  FISH SPECIES ARE ENDEMIC AND MOST ICHTHYOLOGISTS AGREE THAT THIS  ENDEMISM IS GENERATED BY THE BARRIER FORMED BY THE FRESHWATER AND  SEDIMENT DISCHARGE OF LARGE RIVERS IN NORTH-EASTERN SOUTH AMERICA  MAINLY THE AMAZON ORINOCO AND THEIR TRIBUTARIES. HOWEVER LITTLE IS  KNOWN ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF THIS BARRIER AND RECENT STUDIES HAVE  DEMONSTRATED THAT IT CAN BE CROSSED THROUGH DEEP SPONGE BOTTOMS ON THE  OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF OFF NORTH-EASTERN SOUTH AMERICA. MOREOVER THE  RECENT DISCOVERY OF SPECIES REGARDED AS BRAZILIAN ENDEMICS IN THE  EXTREME SOUTHERN CARIBBEAN IS SHOWING THAT THE AMAZON BARRIER IS WEAKER  THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.  MAIN CONCLUSIONS THE AMAZON FRESHWATER AND SEDIMENT OUTFLOW IS A STRONG  BARRIER TO SHALLOW WATER REEF FISH AND OTHER ORGANISMS AND IT IS  PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE ENDEMISM FOUND IN BRAZILIAN COASTAL  HABITATS.

HEREIN SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE PRESENT  AND FUTURE POTENTIAL HABITATS FOR M. HARTTII. ESTIMATIONS WERE MADE  THROUGH THE MAXIMUM ENTROPY APPROACH PREDICTING SUITABLE HABITAT LOSSES  AND GAINS BY THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY. FOR THIS PURPOSE SPECIES  RECORDS PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS AND CURRENT AND FUTURE  ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WERE CORRELATED. THE BEST MODELS WERE CHOSEN  ACCORDING TO THE AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION AIC AND EVALUATED  THROUGH THE PARTIAL ROC AUCRATIO A NEW APPROACH WHICH USES  INDEPENDENT OCCURRENCE DATA. BOTH APPROACHES SHOWED THAT THE MODELS  PERFORMED SATISFACTORILY IN PREDICTING POTENTIAL HABITAT AREAS FOR THE  SPECIES.

Studies on antioxidants from marine algae have increased notably, focusing on searching new sources of natural compounds for different applications, in which tropical species have been shown to have high potential, often improved by stressful environmental conditions during the tide cycle with periods of emersion and submersion. Therefore, in order to characterize the antioxidant activity and relate it to local environmental tide exposure, three species of brown marine algae,Canistrocarpus cervicornis,Dictyopteris delicatula, andLobophora variegatafrom two beaches on the northeast coast of Brazil were studied. Dichloromethane:methanol (DCM:M) and aqueous extracts were tested for ferric reducing antioxidant power, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, and 2,2 `-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) antioxidant assays and total phenolic compounds.

Thus, the aims of this work were to investigate the taxonomic status, geographical distribution and evolutionary history of Bathygobius in the Atlantic and to examine the genetic structure and demographic and phylogeographic history of two species widely distributed in the Atlantic, Bathygobius soporator and Bathygobius geminatus. Our results indicate that a new insular species, Bathygobius brasiliensis sp. nov., can be found in the Western Atlantic, which diverged from its sister species, Bathygobius antilliensis, around 3.03 Mya [cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) d = 0.063; cytochrome b (cyt b) d = 0.074]. There are several old mitochondrial lineages and limited gene flow among major biogeographic provinces of both B. soporator and B. geminatus (COI: overall Œ¶ST = 0.32, P < 0.05; overall Œ¶ST = 0.31, P < 0.05, respectively). We discuss how the Atlantic biogeographical barriers appear to have influenced the formation of the sister species of Bathygobius, and we formulate hypotheses on how the intermittent nature of biogeographical barriers, coupled with the ecological and biological traits of species and ecological and hydrological characteristics of the provinces, shaped the genetic structure and phylogeography of B. soporator and B. geminatus.",NA,NA,NA,

However, MPAs alone may not be effective because species are not isolated from critical impacts occurring outside their boundaries. We evaluated how protecting critical nursery habitats affect the population of an important fishing target, using a 6-year database to predict juvenile hotspots and estimate population trends of the endemic and endangered parrotfish Scarus trispinosus within a mosaic of MPAs at the Abrolhos Bank, NE Brazil. We found that important nursery habitats are within no-take areas, but both juvenile and adult populations still show a declining trend over time. MPAs failed to ensure population maintenance and recovery likely due to overfishing in adjacent areas and the lack of compliance to management rules within multiple-use and within no-take MPAs. MPAs alone are not enough to protect ecologically important endangered species, but is still one of the only conservation strategies, particularly in developing countries.

From an economic perspective, they are fishes with high monetary value and marketability. Seahorses are now listed in Appendix II of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), to ensure that the international trade is not detrimental to the survival of wild populations; the effectiveness evaluation of these international controls needs comparable monitoring data, including evaluation of spatial and temporal trends. This study assesses the seahorse trade in Brazil, aiming to detect trends in catch levels, volumes and prices. Our main findings were: the dried trade was unregulated, without formal records, and primarily domestic, although records of unreported exports existed; it was primarily sustained by incidental captures in trawl nets. The live seahorse trade was mainly destined for exports, and regulated through national quotas. Between 2002 and 2009, mean prices for dried seahorses ranged from US$1.06 ¬± 0.46 (level 1 traders) to US$2.78 ¬± 0.68 (end-sellers) each, while mean prices for each live seahorse traded on the domestic market (1997‚Äì2009) ranged from US$1.13 ¬± 0.02 (level 1 traders) to US$10.08 ¬± 1.71 (retailers). Mean declared export price (2006‚Äì2008) was 15.57 ¬± 10.87. Enhanced implementation of the CITES listing in Brazil will require further research, and additional measures to address both direct and indirect fishing pressure on seahorse populations.",NA,NA,NA,

A digital unsupervised classification based on image segmentation was performed and the classification accuracy was evaluated by an error matrix built between the SAR image classification and a reference map obtained from a TM Landsat-5 classification. The adaptative filters showed the best results for speckle suppression and border preservation, especially the Kuan, Gamma MAP, Lee, Frost and Enhanced Frost filters. Small similarity and area thresholds (5 and 10, respectively) were used for the image segmentation due to the reduced dimensions and the narrow and elongated forms of the reefs. The classification threshold of 99% had a better user's accuracy, but a lower producer's accuracy because it is a more restrictive threshold; therefore, it may be possible that it had a greater omission on reef classification.

Tubastraea spp. (sun corals) have been spreading worldwide, showing rapid increases in abundance and/or spatial occupancy and adverse effects on recipient native ecosystems. In Brazil, they have become major invaders, extending discontinuously for more than 3000 km along the coast. Despite increased research efforts on sun coral ecology/biology over the last decade, information about the species‚Äô environmental tolerance and interactions with native species is still scarce. In this context, temperature may be an important driver, as it affects species interactions, primarily through its influence on organismal physiology. Thus, in the present study we assessed the effects of temperature in the invasive T. coccinea and the native zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum, as well as on their interactions, via a 3-week mesocosm experiment, exposing the species (individually and grafted together) to a temperature range of 16‚Äì31 ¬∞C. This was accompanied by measuring key physiological traits (metabolism, growth, feeding rates and competitive behavior) that underlie species performance, and hence, competitive strength. The results showed that at Arvoredo Island, Brazil, currently the southern distribution limit of both species, (1) T. coccinea exhibited limited capacity to adjust to sudden temperature changes, (2) T. coccinea‚Äôs physical attacks did not affect P. caribaeorum, but induced increased metabolic costs in the former, while triggering increased growth in the latter, leading to eventual overgrowth of the sun coral and (3) that temperature interacted synergistically with the presence of the competitor in both species under high-temperature stress. These findings suggest that T. coccinea‚Äôs successful invasion is mainly associated with r-selected life-history traits, rather than competitive strength or a high plasticity to temperature changes, and thus, communities with specific native competitors and/or a variable thermal regime may be more resistant to sun coral invasion.",NA,NA,NA,

To understand the effects on human communities from including socio-economic objectives in MMAs goals, a cross-site study was designed to examine the socioeconomic and governance effects of MMAs in four countries (Belize, Brazil, Fiji and Panama) as well as ecological factors influencing these outcomes. A socioeconomic and governance monitoring survey is being conducted in each of the MMA coastal communities to understand conditions prior to MMA establishment compared with current conditions. The analysis will assess the MMA effects on food security of coastal residents, livelihoods, human threats to the marine resources, and environmental awareness and knowledge as well as assess the governance effects, including impacts on management structures and strategies, stakeholder participation and representation, property rights and access to resources, management plan compliance by resource users. In addition, enabling factors for MMA effectiveness will be determined. The factors being examined include leadership and long term support of local government, participation by community and all those affected, shared benefits among participants, and alternative livelihoods that may be appropriate in decreasing resource use pressures within MMAs.

SANTANA JR 2020 J SEA RES,2020,Spatial variability of the ichthyoneuston around oceanic islands at the tropical Atlantic,Fish early life stages; Fish larvae; Island mass effect,"Oceanic tropical waters are characteristically oligotrophic. However, current-topography interaction around oceanic islands promotes bio-physical processes, which may enrich surface waters. The ichthyoneuston assemblage at three areas around oceanic islands in the tropical Atlantic was investigated. The aim was to evaluate if the ichthyoneuston was influenced by physical oceanographic processes, such as possible mechanisms of plankton retention promoted by the presence of the islands. Samplings were performed by 20 min long diurnal and nocturnal 500-mu m plankton net hauls using a David-Hempel Catamaran at two transections in each area (Saint Peter and Saint Paul's archipelago, Fernando de Noronha archipelago, and Rocas Atoll). The transections were composed by three stations and were located at opposite sides of the archipelagos (windward and leeward sides of the archipelago). A total of 131 larvae and 3027 eggs, belonging to 16 families and 28 species were collected. Higher densities of eggs were found at the leeward side, which indicates the occurrence of a retention mechanism or spawning at this side. Higher densities of larvae were found at Fernando de Noronha, especially during the nocturnal period. Only one species, Ceratoscopelus warmingii, co-occurred at the three islands. Fernando de Noronha was highlighted as the area with the higher density, abundance and species richness. The waters around this island were positively correlated with chlorophyll -a, which indicates a higher availability of food items and stimulates the selection of this area as a favorable spot for reproduction and early nursery zone. This work highlighted the importance of the relation between abiotic factors and the distribution of fish eggs and larvae inhabiting the neustonic layer around South Atlantic oceanic islands, showing that favorable conditions, e.g. higher phytoplanktonic biomass, may be of fundamental importance to the spawning by adult individuals",NA,NA,NA,

INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE  SUBSEQUENTLY RECAPTURED SHOWED A MEAN MASS CHANGE OF 1.6 KG IN THE  INTERVAL BETWEEN TWO CONSECUTIVE POSTOVIPOSITIONS I.E. AFTER ONE  INTERNIDAL INTERVAL. WE PLOTTED THE MASS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AGAINST THE  CURVILINEAR CARAPACE LENGTH. AN ANALYSIS OF RESIDUAL MASS ABOVE AVERAGE  BODY CONDITION REVEALS THAT FEMALES WITH GOOD BODY CONDITION START  NESTING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON. PREOVIPOSITION MASS WAS MEASURED  WHEN THE FEMALE ABORTED THE NESTING PROCESS. GROSS MASS CHANGE WAS 5.46  KG. MEAN BODY MASS RECOVERY WAS 3.2 KG. BODY MASS RECOVERY WAS ALWAYS  SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE CHANGE IN GROSS MASS. THIS IS IN AGREEMENT  WITH THE OBSERVED MASS LOSS TENDENCY THROUGHOUT THE BREEDING SEASON FOR  THIS SPECIES. MASS RECOVERY WAS ANALYZED USING ALLOMETRIC LAW  CONVERTING BOTH LOSS IN BODY MASS AND TOTAL EGG MASS TO ENERGY.

THIS STUDY PRESENTS TWO NEW SYSTEMS THAT PERMIT PRECISE POINT  SAMPLING OF MICRO- AND MESOZOOPLANKTON AND LARVAE OF INVERTEBRATES AND  FISH THE CHANNEL MIDWATER NEUSTON NET CMNN AND THE REEF EDGE NET  REN. BOTH ARE MOORED SYSTEMS THAT ARE EQUIPPED WITH 64- AND 300-MU M  MESH NETS. THE CMNN SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED FOR CONTINUOUS SAMPLING IN TIDAL  CHANNELS BETWEEN REEF PATCHES. IT SAMPLES AT THREE PRECISE DEPTH LAYERS  EPINEUSTON 0 M TO 0.075 M HYPONEUSTON 0.075 M TO 0.225 M1 M LAYER  0.925 M TO 1.075 M DEPTH. THE REN SYSTEM ALLOWS SAMPLING AT PRECISE  ADJUSTABLE DEPTHS AT GIVEN DISTANCES FROM THE REEF EDGE. THE OBJECTIVE  OF THE REN IS TO COLLECT ORGANISMS THAT ARE WASHED FROM REEF TOPS AND  REEF EDGES WITH THE EBB FLOW. THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE TWO NEW SYSTEMS  WAS EVALUATED AND COMPARED WITH RESULTS OBTAINED BY USING COMMON RING  NETS IN HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE TOWS. FIELDWORK WAS PERFORMED AT TWO REEF  PATCHES OF THE TAMANDARE REEF SYSTEM BRAZIL IN NOVEMBER 2015. THE CMNN  AND REN SHOWED SIMILAR PERFORMANCE IN COMPARISON WITH RING NET TOWS  CAPTURING MICROZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS VELIGER POLYCHAETE  DECAPOD AND BARNACLE LARVAE IN SIMILAR ABUNDANCES. FOR THE  MESOZOOPLANLCTON THE REN PRESENTED A SIMILAR PERFORMANCE TO THE RING  NET TOWS EFFICIENTLY CAPTURING DECAPOD CRUSTACEAN AND FISH LARVAE AS  WELL AS FISH EGGS. THE CMNN SHOWED LOWER ABUNDANCE OF DECAPOD LARVAE AND  FISH EGGS BUT SHOWED A GOOD PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUANTIFICATION OF FISH  LARVAE. THE TWO NEW PASSIVE NETS SHOWED A HIGH EFFECTIVENESS IN  COLLECTING LARVAE AND ADVANTAGES OVER TOWS WITH RING NETS SINCE THEY  STAY FOR SEVERAL HOURS CONTINUOUSLY CAPTURING LARVAL AGGREGATIONS DURING  SPAWNING EVENTS. THIS HIGH CAPTURING EFFICIENCY IS PROBABLY RELATED TO  THE AVOIDANCE OF SAMPLE REFLUX IN THE LONG NETS THAT SINK AND CLOSE AT  SLACK TIDE FOR THE CMNN AND DUE TO THE LONG TRAP-LIKE DESIGN WITH  FUNNEL-SHAPED INTERNAL ``ANTI-REFLUX'' NETS FOR THE REN.

THE SMALL-SCALE DISTRIBUTION AND DETAILED  ANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUAL BIOMASS OF MESOZOOPLANKTON WERE STUDIED IN THE  COASTAL REEFS OF TAMANDARE BRAZIL. MESOZOOPLANKTON > 300 MU M WAS  COLLECTED DURING NOCTURNAL EBB TIDES AT NEW MOON USING THREE DIFFERENT  DEVICES TO SAMPLE AT THREE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS A STANDARD RING NET  THAT WAS TOWED AT SUBSURFACE THE CHANNEL MIDWATER NEUSTON NET THAT  COLLECTED AT MIDWATER IN CHANNELS BETWEEN PATCH REEFS AND THE REEF EDGE  NET THAT CAPTURED ORGANISMS THAT ARE WASHED BY EBB CURRENTS FROM REEF  TOPS TOWARD THE REEF EDGE. SAMPLES WERE ANALYZED USING A ZOOSCAN TO  OBTAIN ABUNDANCES AND BIOVOLUME OF EACH TAXONOMIC GROUP. SPECIFIC  BIOMASS MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN TO OBTAIN ALLOMETRIC EQUATIONS USED TO  CALCULATE ZOOPLANKTON BIOMASS FROM BIOVOLUME. THE MESOZOOPLANKTON WERE  SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ABUNDANT AT SUBSURFACE AND AT THE REEF EDGE COMPARED  TO CHANNEL ENVIRONMENTS. THE HIGH ABUNDANCE OF ORGANISMS AT REEF EDGES  SUGGESTS A LOW PREDATION PRESSURE ON ZOOPLANKTON AT NEAR-BOTTOM AREAS  SINCE THE REEFS OF TAMANDARE PRESENT A LOW COVERAGE OF PLANKTIVOROUS  CORALS BEING DOMINATED BY MACROALGAE. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT RATHER  THAN SINKS THESE ECOSYSTEMS MAY BE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT SOURCES OF  ZOOPLANKTON AVAILABLE FOR PLANKTIVOROUS SPECIES. REGARDING ZOOPLANKTON  COMPOSITION WE FOUND LARGE AMOUNTS OF INITIAL STAGES OF MEROPLANKTONIC  LARVAE AND NEWLY HATCHED FISH EGGS WHICH PRESENTED CONSISTENTLY GREATER  ABUNDANCES COMPARED TO HOLOPLANKTON AND EMERGENT BENTHIC TAXA. DECAPOD  LARVAE WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT GROUP OF THE MEROPLANKTON BUT CIRRIPEDIAN  NAUPLII STOMATOPOD LARVAE FISH LARVAE AND FISH EGGS WERE ALSO  ABUNDANT. MORE THAN 50\% OF THE TOTAL BIOMASS WAS DUE TO MEROPLANKTON  TAXA MAINLY COMPOSED OF DECAPOD LARVAE.

In the short term microcosm experiment M. hispida extruded a substantial amount of mesenterial filaments in an aggressive response to proximity to both invasive species within a few hours. However, in the field only the native coral suffered necrosis, which was visible after only four days. The use of physical barriers to separate chemical and physical effects demonstrated that antagonistic effects were far greater in the absence of a physical barrier than in the partial or complete barrier treatments, so although there is evidence that these invasive corals may produce allelochemicals against possible competitors we demonstrated that the main mechanism Tubastraea spp uses to exclude the native coral species is principally a rapid physical response.",NA,NA,NA,

SANTOS RG 2020 ENVIRON POLLUT,2020,Exploring plastic-induced satiety in foraging green turtles,Herbivory; Foraging ecology; Plastic pollution; Chelonia mydas,"In the last decade many studies have described the ingestion of plastic in marine animals. While most studies were dedicated to understanding the pre-ingestion processes involving decision-making foraging choices based on visual and olfactory cues of animals, our knowledge in the post-ingestion consequences remains limited. Here we proposed a theoretical complementary view of post-ingestion consequences, attempting to connect plastic ingestion with plastic-induced satiety. We analyzed data of plastic ingestion and dietary information of 223 immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from tropical Brazilian reefs in order to understand the impacts of plastic ingestion on foraging behavior. Generalized linear mixing models and permutational analysis of variance suggested that plastic accumulations in esophagus, stomach and intestine differed in their impact on green turtle's food intake. At the initial stages of plastic ingestion, where the plastic still in the stomach, an increase in food intake was observed. The accumulation of plastic in the gastrointestinal tract can reduce food intake likely leading to plastic-induced satiety. Our results also suggest that higher amounts of plastics in the gastrointestinal tract may led to underweight and emaciated turtles. We hope that adopting and refining our proposed framework will help to clarify the post-ingestion consequences of plastic ingestion in wildlife",UNIV FED ESPIRITO SANTO,"SANTOS, RG (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED ESPIRITO SANTO, CCHN, DEPT OCEANOG \& ECOL, BR-29075910 VITORIA, ES, BRAZIL",FAPESFUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE ESPIRITU SANTO (FAPES); CAPESCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); CNPQCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [308867/2006-8]; TAMAR/ICMBIO,

Four hunting tactics were recorded both in and out of the water: (1) search at pool rims and rock bases, poking into crevices and holes; (2) stealthy approach to previously sighted prey; (3) chasing of prey; (4) ambush from crevices and under rocks. As the chain moray uses varied hunting techniques and its crab hunting is mostly visually guided, its generally unobtrusive foraging attracts little or no attention from tide-pool fishes. Part of the foraging is done out of the water on exposed reefs; fish are therefore unable to follow the moray and take advantage of its hunting activities.",UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS,NA,NA,

CENTRALITY MEASURES  ALLOW QUANTIFICATION OF HOW CENTRAL OR PERIPHERAL A SPECIES IS WITHIN A  NETWORK THUS INFORMING ABOUT THE ROLE OF EACH SPECIES IN NETWORK  ORGANIZATION DYNAMICS AND STABILITY. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE ADDRESSED  THE QUESTION WHETHER THE STRUCTURAL POSITION OF SPECIES IN THE NETWORK  I.E. THEIR TOPOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE RELATES TO THEIR ECOLOGICAL TRAITS.  WE STUDIED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLEANER AND CLIENT REEF FISHES TO  IDENTIFY CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL SPECIES WITHIN A MUTUALISTIC NETWORK  AND INVESTIGATED FIVE ECOLOGICAL CORRELATES. WE USED THREE MEASURES TO  ESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF CENTRALITY OF A SPECIES FOR DISTINCT STRUCTURAL  PATTERNS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS AND THE STRUCTURAL  PROXIMITY TO OTHER SPECIES. THROUGH THE USE OF A PRINCIPAL COMPONENT  ANALYSIS PCA WE OBSERVED THAT THE CENTRALITY MEASURES WERE HIGHLY  CORRELATED 92.5\% IN THE STUDIED NETWORK WHICH INDICATES THAT THE  SAME SPECIES PLAYS A SIMILAR ROLE FOR THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURAL PATTERNS.  THREE CLEANER AND TEN CLIENT SPECIES HAD POSITIVE VALUES OF CENTRALITY  WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THESE SPECIES ARE MODULATING ECOLOGICAL AND  EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS WITHIN THE NETWORK. HIGHER CENTRALITIES WERE  RELATED TO HIGHER ABUNDANCES AND FEEDING HABITS FOR CLIENT FISHES BUT  NOT FOR CLEANERS. THE HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN CENTRALITY MEASURES IN  THE PRESENT STUDY IS LIKELY RELATED TO THE NESTED STRUCTURE OF THE  CLEANING NETWORK. THE CLEANER SPECIES' SET BY HAVING CENTRAL SPECIES  THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST ABUNDANT ONES BEARS POTENTIALLY MORE  VULNERABLE POINTS FOR NETWORK COHESIVENESS. ADDITIONALLY THE PRESENT  STUDY GENERALIZES PREVIOUS FINDINGS FOR PLANT-ANIMAL MUTUALISMS AS IT  SHOWS THAT THE STRUCTURE OF MARINE MUTUALISMS IS ALSO RELATED TO A  COMPLEX INTERPLAY BETWEEN ABUNDANCE AND NICHE-RELATED FEATURES.,UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS,NA,NA,

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND INCREASED SEAWATER  TEMPERATURES ARE AMONG THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON. THE  COMPREHENSION OF THE EFFECTS OF THESE ALTERATIONS ON MARINE ORGANISMS  IN PARTICULAR ON CALCIFIED MACROALGAE IS STILL MODEST DESPITE ITS GREAT  IMPORTANCE. THERE ARE EVIDENCES THAT MACROALGAE INHABITING HIGHLY  VARIABLE ENVIRONMENTS ARE RELATIVELY RESILIENT TO SUCH CHANGES. THUS  THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE EXPERIMENTALLY THE EFFECTS OF  CO2-DRIVEN OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND TEMPERATURE RISES ON THE  PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF CALCIFIED MACROALGAE INHABITING THE INTERTIDAL REGION  A HIGHLY VARIABLE ENVIRONMENT. THE EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED IN A REEF  MESOCOSM IN A TROPICAL REGION ON THE BRAZILIAN COAST USING THREE  SPECIES OF FRONDOSE CALCIFYING MACROALGAE HALIMEDA CUNEATA PADINA  GYMNOSPORA AND TRICLEOCARPA CYLINDRICA AND CRUSTOSE CORALLINE ALGAE.  THE ACIDIFICATION EXPERIMENT CONSISTED OF THREE TREATMENTS WITH PH  LEVELS BELOW THOSE OCCURRING IN THE REGION -0.3 -0.6 -0.9. FOR THE  TEMPERATURE EXPERIMENT THREE TEMPERATURE LEVELS ABOVE THOSE OCCURRING  NATURALLY IN THE REGION +1+2+4 DEGREES C WERE DETERMINED. THE  RESULTS OF THE ACIDIFICATION EXPERIMENT INDICATE AN INCREASE ON THE  OPTIMUM QUANTUM YIELD BY T.

SIGNIFICANT  EFFECTS OF THE TEMPERATURE EXPERIMENT WERE LIMITED TO AN ENHANCEMENT OF  THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PERFORMANCE BY H. CUNEATA ALTHOUGH ONLY AT A MODEST  TEMPERATURE INCREASE +1 DEGREES C. IN GENERAL THE RESULTS INDICATE A  POSSIBLE PHOTOSYNTHETIC ADAPTATION AND/OR ACCLIMATION OF THE STUDIED  MACROALGAE TO THE EXPECTED FUTURE OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND TEMPERATURE  RISES AS SEPARATE FACTORS.

OUT OF A TOTAL OF 336 PROTECTED AREAS IDENTIFIED IN  BRAZILIAN COASTAL AND MARINE AREAS THE NORTH PLATFORM HAS THE LARGEST  PROTECTED AREA BUT THE ECOSYSTEM WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PROTECTED  AREA PREDOMINANTLY SUSTAINABLE AREAS WAS THE EAST COAST FOLLOWED BY  THE SOUTH PLATFORM. ONE OF THE REASONS THE EASTERN COAST OF BRAZIL TO  HAVE MORE PROTECTED AREAS IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS A LARGEST AMOUNT OF  CORAL REEFS. ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE  CREATION OF PROTECTED AREAS FOR SUSTAINABLE USE. THE COASTAL REGION OF  BRAZIL HAS ACHIEVED THE GOAL PROPOSED BY THE SEVENTH CONFERENCE OF THE  PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY 7 BUT ONLY THEN  THROUGH THE CATEGORY V OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF  NATURE WHICH IS NOT THE BEST EFFICIENT MEANS OF CONSERVING RESOURCES.  THE GOAL FOR MARINE CONSERVATION SHOWS ONLY THE AREA ABOVE THE  RECOMMENDED UNDER PROTECTION IN NORTH PLATFORM. THE MARINE PORTION OF  THE EAST COAST AND THE SOUTH PLATFORM HAS FEW PROTECTED AREAS  REGARDLESS OF CATEGORY MANAGEMENT. WE CONSIDER THE COASTAL REGION THE  RANGE OF 12 NAUTICAL MILES FROM BASELINES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA. AS FOR THE NUMBER  OF STRATEGIES PERMITTED BY LAW AND USED FOR THE CONSERVATION OF COASTAL  AND MARINE SYSTEMS COASTAL SYSTEMS SHOW A HIGHER NUMBER WHEN COMPARED  WITH THE MARINE SYSTEM. WE SUGGEST THAT THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD  SPECIFY STRATEGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF MARINE SYSTEMS AND EXPAND THE  PROTECTED AREAS OF ALL BARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. C 2013 ELSEVIER LTD.

Additionally, the ItamaracaÃÅ Estuarine System (IES) (near Recife, Pernambuco State) was chosen for a mesoscale investigation. Export of water masses from the IES was restricted to the reef line, about 6 km from the coast. In spite of this geomorphological and hydrographical barrier, estuarine decapod larvae were exported to about 15 km offshore. On the inshore shelf off Pernambuco State (6 to 15 km offshore), decapod larvae dominated in abundance and biomass. Here, the dominant decapod groups were Brachyura (late-stage unidentified zoeae of type A, and Xanthidae), Caridea, Porcellanidae, Anomura, and Callianassidae. In the IES, the most abundant decapod taxa were: first-stage zoeae of Brachyura (Uca spp., Ucides cordatus, Grapsidae, Xanthidae, and unidentified zoeae of type ‚ÄúA‚Äù), Lucifer faxoni, Upogebiidae, Caridea, Acetes americanus, and Anomura. At distances of more than 20 km off Pernambuco and at most stations off CearaÃÅ State, the zooplankton was characterized by an oceanic copepod community.

Additionally, samples were taken from the ItamaracaÃÅ Estuarine System (IES), near Recife, for comparison. The data on naturally occurring stable isotopes suggest that export of POM from the IES was restricted to the reef line. This was evident by a maximum of Œ¥13C on the inshore shelf (app. 6 to 15 km offshore). There was no measurable estuarine influence on Œ¥13C of POM and zooplankton on the shelf. No significant differences were observed in Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N between the samples taken at shelf stations off Pernambuco and CearaÃÅ states, although mangrove cover in Pernambuco is more than 10 times higher than in CearaÃÅ. Œ¥13C values of shelf zooplankton varied between -16.3 and -19.8 ‚Ä∞ PDB. The difference in Œ¥13C between zooplankton and POM was 4.2 ¬± 1.8 ‚Ä∞. Decapod crustacean larvae showed Œ¥13C values between ‚Äì19.8 and ‚Äì17.2 ‚Ä∞ PDB. Copepods had Œ¥13C values between ‚Äì19.5 and ‚Äì18.7 ‚Ä∞ PDB. The differences in Œ¥13C between copepods and chaetognaths found inshore and offshore were 1.1 and 1.0 ‚Ä∞ PDB, respectively. After ‚ÄúC/N- correcting‚Äú Œ¥13C values, zooplankton still had significantly higher values than POM. POM Œ¥15N varied between 1.6 and 5.6 ‚Ä∞. Zooplankton was significantly higher in 15N compared with POM at estuarine and shelf stations. The difference in Œ¥15N was 3.2 ‚Ä∞. Decapod larvae showed relatively low Œ¥15N values (similar to or even lower than zooplankton subsamples), indicating a relatively low trophic position. Œ¥13C values of decapod larvae were generally close to the values measured for the oceanic copepod community, indicating a similarity in the utilization of pelagic primary carbon sources.",UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO,"SCHWAMBORN, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO, DEPT OCEANOG, CENTO TECNOL GOECIENCIAS, AV ARQUITETURA S-N, BR-50739901 RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL",NA,

Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were low (0.28-0.53). Eleven coral species were recorded (total coral coverage = 6.6-31.8%). Dominant reef building drganisms were the endemic coral Mussismilia braziliensis (1.9-24.5% cover) and coralline algae (13.8- 19.5% cover). Significant differences among localities were detected in colony sizes, and in point-to-colony and colony-to-colony distances for some species, and among benthic communities.

A mapping effort was conducted to produce detailed bathymetry, high-(spectral, spatial and digital)- resolution imagery, and benthic habitat classification. Scuba-based ecological census was conducted at sixty sites for ground-truthing. Observations logged included substrate type, species or functional groups of Cnidaria (Anthozoa and Hidrozoa Classes), and functional groups of flora. A visual estimate of coverage areas was provided in a semi-quantitative hierarchy. High-definition videography and photography, as well as sediment and foraminifera sampling were also carried out. RGB triplets highlight WorldView 2‚Äôs Coastal Blue Band capable of penetrating the water column. The Quick Bird scene was used for comparison and in decorrelation stretch. Heads-up, on-screen photo-interpretation over select RGB triplets generated polygons in the GIS. The processing took into consideration the geomorphology, interpreted from a bathymetry dataset and its derivatives (selected isobaths, hillshade, classified slope), as well as a generalized Inverse Distance Weighed model of the predominant bottom type compiled from the scuba-based videography-and-field-book database stored in the GIS. The resulting classification scheme used three basic attributes to describe each mapped polygon. Coral cover is generally low in the shallower water and increases with water depth. The offshore geology is predominantly composed of smooth compact sediment. Still, coral or accreted carbonate reef totally obscure the underlying geology ",NA,NA,NA,

The indices showed a transition from rarity to dominance throughout the region as well as range expansion; in contrast at one site, where a pilot management initiative of manual control has been carried out, there was a reduction in abundance over time. Abundance values were compared to distance from possible points of introduction to pinpoint where the initial introduction occurred. The observed relationship between the possible points of entry and abundance of the two Tubastraea species was highly significant for the achorage and oil terminal whereas somewhat less so for the shipyard and port. The data obtained in this study are being used to plan further urgent management actions to control the biological invasion of the two Tubastraea species throughout the region, as well as being applied in modeling the range expansion into other regions.",UNIV ESTADO RIO DE JANEIRO,"CREED, JC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADO RIO DE JANEIRO, DEPT ECOL, 524 RUA SAO FRANCISCO XAVIER,PHLC SALA 220, BR-20550900 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL",PROGRAMA DE INCENTIVO A PRODUCAO CIENTIFICA; TECNICA E ARTISTICA; UERJ; CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); FUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIROFUNDACAO CARLOS CHAGAS FILHO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO (FAPERJ) [E-25/170669/2004]; PETROBRAS THROUGH THE PROGRAMA PETROBRAS AMBIENTAL,

White plague-like disease (WPL) is a widespread disease with a complex etiology that infects several coral species, including the Brazilian endemic speciesMussismilia braziliensis. Gene expression profiles of healthy and WPL-affectedM. braziliensiswere analyzed in winter and summer seasons. The de novo assembly of theM. braziliensistranscriptome from healthy and white plague samples produced a reference transcriptome containing 119,088 transcripts. WPL-diseased samples were characterized by repression of immune system and cellular defense processes. Autophagy and cellular adhesion transcripts were also repressed in WPL samples, suggesting exhaustion of the coral host defenses. Seasonal variation leads to plasticity in transcription with upregulation of intracellular signal transduction, apoptosis regulation, and oocyte development in the summer. Analysis of the active bacterial rRNA indicated thatPantoeabacteria were more abundant in WPL corals, whileTistlia,Fulvivirga, and Gamma proteobacteriaG a0077536 were more abundant in healthy samples.Cyanobacteriaproliferation was also observed in WPL, mostly in the winter.

Reefs are among the most affected ecosystems, where the complex behavioral repertoire of fishes is usually an indicator of environmental impacts. Here, we examined whether temperature (28 and 34 degrees C) and habitat complexity (high and low) interact to affect the agonistic behavior (mirror test) of the dusky damselfish (Stegastes fuscus), a key species in Brazilian reefs because of its gardening capacity and territorial behavior. Higher temperatures altered basal behavior in both high and low-complexity conditions. Fish kept at 28 degrees C under the high-complexity condition were more aggressive than those at a higher temperature (34 degrees C) and in a low-complexity condition, which also exhibited lower dispersion. Our data show that changes in behavior of coral reef fish is associated to fluctuations in environmental conditions.

The coral reefs of Tamandare `-Brazil, located at Costa dos Corais marine protected area (MPA), encompass a mosaic of interconnected habitats of complex geomorphology, including coral reefs, algal, and seagrass beds. These coastal habitats are subjected to chronic impacts such as sedimentation, reef erosion, and increasing human use, leading to habitat loss. Despite their social and ecological importance and the conservationmeasures in place, bathymetric and habitat maps of this coast are lacking. Indeed, in situ surveys are not always feasible in shallow coral reef areas. The present study offers a detailed bathymetric mapping of the area using multiresolution satellite imagery. One Landsat-8 (December 2016) and one WorldView-03 (February 2017) imagery were used to derive medium (30-m) and high-resolution (2-m) bathymetry of the study area. Single-beam echo sounder surveys were performed to obtain field data to calibrate the depth-retrieving algorithms: linear model, ratio band model, principal component analyses of the transformed bands, and geographically weighted regressions (GWR). For both resolution datasets, results showed that the algorithms' RMS were significantly improved by theGWR technique (RMS. 0.9) because of adaptability to the bottom heterogeneity found in complex areas such as coral reefs. Specific geomorphological reef zones were recognizable in the resulting bathymetric maps, such as intrareef lagoon, reef crest, fore-reef, and reef flat. This research concluded that affordable methods such as single-beam data coupled with satellite imagery through GWR can provide the required inputs for mapping shallow areas with complex relief. Such results may be further used to habitat mapping, necessary to inform the multiple-use zonation foreseen in MPA management plans",NA,NA,NA,

In the natural environment, fish occupies territories of 2.74 +/- 1.3 m(2)and the most frequent behaviours exhibited were monitoring swimming, feeding, shelter occupation and agonistic interactions. Larger-territory individuals spend more time in monitoring swimming than smaller-territory ones, which results in a reduction of food intake. Agonistic interactions were more frequent with heterospecifics than conspecifics. Whenever agonistic interaction occurred, confrontations were not frequent. Territorial behaviour in the lab was evaluated considering two variables: prior residence and familiarity between conspecific opponents. Resident fish invested more against intruders irrespective of the intruder's identity (familiar or unfamiliar). When no previous territory was established,S. fuscusshowed lower aggressive behaviour, and it was even lower when a familiar fish was the opponent. Data from the field and the lab suggest thatS. fuscusterritoriality and aggression are related to the size of the defended area and the competitor's identity. Thus, reduced reef areas may result in increased interindividual aggression, while the intruders' recognition may be a key trait controlling agonistic behaviour in the reef community whereS. fuscusis inserted",NA,NA,NA,

Protozoa, nematodes, bdelloid rotifers and cuticles of cryptostigmatid mites were found in the soil; most of the species identified were microbial feeders with a cosmopolitan distribution. The only terrestrial flora observed were green and blue-green algae and a nematode-predacious fungus, continuous sea-spray upon the Rocks preventing the-growth of higher plants: Breeding populations of brown boobies and black and brown noddies were observed and counted.

Distribution patterns are described using length frequencies and catch rates. Stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15), along with stomach contents, were analysed to determine the diet of the spotted goatfish. Multivariate analysis and numerical indicators of the diet, such as numerical frequency. frequency of occurrence and weight percentage, were computed to evaluate the diet composition. The mean trophic position was defined using both stable isotope ratios and stomach content analysis. The length at first maturity for the species was determined as 13.7 cm. A slight pattern in size distribution was observed, with mean size increasing with depth along the shelf. The diet was mainly composed of crustaceans, teleosts and Polychaeta. No clear dietary difference was found between habitat types, water depth or latitude. Both trophic positions estimated by stable isotopes and stomach contents analysis ranged between levels 3 and 4. P. maculatus was found to be feeding on many rare and infrequent prey items, classifying it as a generalist zoobenthivorous predator, probably due to its efficient search strategy",UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO,"SOARES, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT PESCA \& AQUICULTURA, BR-52171900 RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL","FRENCH OCEANOGRAPHIC FLEET; IRD; CAPES (COORDINATION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONNEL)COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ) [305014/2016-1, 312211/2017-1]; TAPIOCA, PROGRAMME CAPES/COFECUB [88881.142689/2017-01]; PADDLE PROJECT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION'S HORIZON 2020 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME [73427]",

Within an integrated working context, this study aimed to identify the major prey for the fish species of AracÃßaÃÅ Bay through an analysis of stomach contents. AracÃßaÃÅ Bay is a sheltered, low tide terrace that presents seasonal hydrodynamics, primary productivity and organism communities. A total of 1253 stomachs from 28 fish species were sampled in March 2013 and January 2014 (austral summer) and in June 2013 (austral winter). A hierarchical cluster analysis (Bray-Curtis similarity index) was performed on the matrix of the index of relative importance (IRI%) of the food items of 15 species collected in both seasons. Five and four major trophic groups were recorded for the summer and winter, respectively (SIMPROF). A two-way PERMANOVA test showed significant differences in the prey compositions among the trophic groups but not the seasons. The annual dendrogram showed four trophic groups: shrimp feeders (8 species), teleostean fish feeders (2 species), copepod feeders (2 species), and benthic invertebrate feeders (3 species). Seasonal species shifts among the trophic groups related to the seasonal recruitment of relatively abundant fish species during the summer were recorded mainly between the teleostean fish feeder and shrimp feeder groups. Overall, the seasonal dynamics of the waters and the consequent prey abundance influenced the resource availability. Resource partitioning and feeding plasticity allowed the species to optimize the use of available prey in the bay. These results represent a contribution toward understanding the local food web, to construct a trophic model, and to contribute to its sustainable integrated management.",NA,NA,NA,

Most studies on reef systems have been conducted for true coral reefs, ecosystems that show calcareous formations with extensive coral cover and diversity. The aim of this study was to analyse the coverage of benthic assemblages in a submerged sandstone reef (22‚Äì24 m) in a relatively non-explored region (Tropical South-western Atlantic). In this area, filamentous algae (43.6%) and sponges (19.6%) are the main components of the benthic reef assemblages. Other benthic reef fauna (ascidians, corals and zoanthids) showed lower coverage, although their importance may vary depending on the area. A negative correlation between filamentous algae and slow-growing reef-building organisms (calcareous algae) was observed. High sand coverage (19.6%) over the reef revealed a high rate of silting. A low coral diversity (only two resilient species) was quantified, and most of the coral colonies were small-sized.

Scuba divers observed this coral in the western equatorial Atlantic in January 2020, growing at high densities on a shipwreck from World War II (sunk in 1943) at a depth of approximately 32 m. Available footage from the beginning of the decade (2012-2018) shows no obvious signs of sun coral on this shipwreck, suggesting recent colonization and range expansion. The recent evidence of expansion was found 200 km east of the last record, which was also found on a WWII shipwreck (sunk in 1942) in 2016. We have identified hundreds of overlooked WWII shipwrecks, as well as new wrecks in shallow and mesophotic waters, that may provide stepping-stone habitats for this coral to expand its distribution in the Atlantic. We discuss the role of shipwrecks as a network of stepping stones for the sun coral spread, creating complementary paths for the invasiveness by overcoming physiological traits and the short lifespan of the coral larvae. Previous research underestimates the importance of these artificial stepping-stone patches in sustaining crucial dispersal events and range expansion of invasive species.

However, discussions regarding the conservation of these unique ecosystems are scarce. To address this issue, we identified the features of MCEs that demonstrate they should be considered as a global conservation priority. Some MCEs are characterized by their well-preserved and unique seascapes; their narrow environmental tolerance and high vulnerability to anthropogenic effects; and their slow recovery and reduced reproductive performance. The unique biodiversity of MCEs includes depth-adapted specialist species and new species, most of which are threatened or important fishery resources. MCEs also provide refuge against human stressors, valuable ecosystem services, and ecological connectivity. MCEs generally meet the criteria to be classified as Ecologically and Biologically Significant Marine Areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity. However, we highlight that many MCEs worldwide are threatened and not yet adequately protected by fishery regulations, marine protected areas, or considered in marine spatial planning.

ONE HYPOTHESIS  IS THAT THESE CHANGES WERE DUE TO OUT-GASSING OF C-14-DEPLETED CARBON  FROM THE ABYSSAL OCEAN. RECONSTRUCTIONS OF FORAMINIFERAL DELTA C-14  FROM THE EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC ARABIAN SEA AND HIGH LATITUDE NORTH  ATLANTIC SHOW THAT SEVERE DEPLETIONS IN C-14 OCCURRED AT INTERMEDIATE  WATER DEPTHS DURING THE LAST DEGLACIATION. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT  C-14-DEPLETED WATER FROM THE ABYSS UPWELLED IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN AND  WAS THEN CARRIED BY ANTARCTIC INTERMEDIATE WATER AAIW TO THESE SITES.  HOWEVER LOCATIONS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC IN THE DIRECT PATH OF MODERN-DAY  AAIW DO NOT EXHIBIT THE DELTA C-14 EXCURSION AND THEREFORE CAST DOUBT  UPON THE AAIW MECHANISM DE POL-HOLZ ET AL. 2010 ROSE ET AL. 2010.  HERE WE EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT A DEGLACIAL C-14 ANOMALY OCCURRED AT  INTERMEDIATE DEPTHS IN THE SOUTHWEST ATLANTIC. WE FIND THAT THE  DEGLACIAL BENTHIC DELTA C-14 TREND AT OUR SITE IS SIMILAR TO THE  ATMOSPHERIC DELTA C-14 TREND. OUR RESULTS ARE ALSO LARGELY CONSISTENT  WITH RESULTS FROM U/TH-DATED CORALS AT SHALLOWER WATER DEPTHS ON THE  BRAZIL MARGIN MANGINI ET AL. 2010.

Considering their morphological and morphodynamic particularities, Trenhaile (2004) modeled the accumulation and dynamics of beaches on shore platforms, on mesotidal and macrotidal coast. Although, this model had not been verified or tested in the field, it can be useful to understand coastal geomorphology. Therefore, this study aims to apply the Trenhaile (2004) model to beaches on horizontal shore platforms, located on the microtidal coast of Espirito Santo (Brazil), and validate it using local data. For this, the morphological and morphodynamic particularities of the studied beaches were considered when applying and interpreting the model results. Besides the Trenhaile (2004) model variables, the role of wave runup was considered in the upward growth of the berm and then in the beach height. The model results and field data showed that the gradients and elevations of shore platforms in the study area are suitable to form the beaches while wider shore platforms seem to contribute to the development of wider beaches. The platforms in the study area also influence accommodation space, cross-shore sediment exchanges and beach mobility. Field data was used to test the applicability of Trenhaile's (2004) model in the study area. The model was found to be a potentially useful tool in coastal management helping to understand coastal geomorphology",NA,NA,NA,

THIS IS  OPPOSITE TO THE CORRELATION EXPECTED AS PREVIOUS WORK HAS SUGGESTED  THAT HIGHER SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES OCCUR IN THE GULF OF GUINEA DURING  PERIODS OF LOW RAINFALL IN THE SAHEL. SUCH AN ASSOCIATION WOULD LEAD TO  A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SAHEL PRECIPITATION AND SKELETAL  DELTA18O. THE EXPLANATION FOR THE OBSERVED INVERSE CORRELATION IS THAT  THE SALINITY OF THE GULF OF GUINEA IS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE OUTFLOW  FROM THE NIGER AND CONGO RIVERS. THESE PERIODS OF HIGH FRESHWATER INPUT  ALSO CORRELATE WITH PERIODS OF HIGHER RAINFALL IN THE SUB-SAHARA AND  THEREFORE AFFECT THE DELTA18O VALUES OF THE CORAL SKELETON.

Using a series of images spanning nine years, we detected the introduction and followed the expansion of the NIS Tubastraea coccinea and T. tagusensis populations at a recreational marina in a region of Southeastern Brazil where sun-corals are rarely found on natural substrates. Because sun corals are known to reduce diversity in natural invaded environments, we evaluated how different densities of sun-corals affected the benthic community. Overall, the NIS populations have grown exponentially from 2010 to 2019 inside the marina, occupying up to 60\% of the available space. However, the population growth in the breakwater stopped in 2016. Local variation in the population growth across the marina might be associated with the high phytoplankton biomass and larval retention inside the marina, which are results of the lower hydrodynamics. The expansion of sun-coral coverage did not significantly affect the richness of benthic communities but was associated with a reduction of the native bryozoan Amathia brasiliensis, the overall abundance of mobile crustaceans, and an increase in the area covered by the exotic bryozoan S. errata. The fast substitution of a native ecosystem engineer for a NIS suggests signs of invasion meltdown associated with the expansion of Tubastraea spp",UNIV FED ABC UFABC,"TANASOVICI, RM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED ABC UFABC, CTR CIENCIAS NAT \& HUMANAS, RUA ARCTURUS 03, BR-09606070 SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, SP, BRAZIL",SCIENTIFIC INITIATION PROGRAM OF THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF ABC THROUGH CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ)CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ); FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP)FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE SAO PAULO (FAPESP) [2016/17647-5],

The following hypotheses were tested: (1) the distribution of sea anemones (Actiniaria and Corallimorpharia) corroborates SWA biogeographic provinces, (2) their distribution presents a richness peak at mid-latitudes, and (3) temperature is the main abiotic driver that structures their species composition. Occurrences/registries were obtained mainly from published sources. We adopted Sorensen dissimilarity and cluster analyses to compare fauna compositions. To verify latitudinal richness patterns, we used a Hill's numbers approach through rarefaction and extrapolation techniques. Partial redundancy analysis was performed to identify which drivers contribute more to the distribution. The sea anemone faunas are congruent with the following SWA provinces: Brazilian province (BP, 0 to 33 degrees S), Argentinian province (36 to 43 degrees S), and Patagonian province (43 to 56 degrees S), and all differ from the Caribbean province (CP). Although there is a high similarity among the BP and the CP, they form significant clusters with well-supported endemism levels (> 19\%). An elevated richness was found at 19-23 degrees S, in the BP southeast (34 spp. and 13\% of endemism), supporting an SWA biodiversity center. Temperature explained 64\% of the distribution, and the Amazonas-Orinoco and La Plata estuaries act as soft barriers. The sea anemone distribution can be explained by features of the local current systems, combined with isolation through barriers and different ecological tolerances. Furthermore, the patterns reported herein (unprecedented for the group) are similar to those of other marine taxa.

A five-year survey in the shallow marine waters (up to 30 m) and a literature review on the data published for TMV have been conducted to document the biodiversity of the benthic fauna. Here we report on ten new records of decapod crustaceans from TMV: Gnathophyllum americanum and Thor amboinensis are circumtropical in distribution, whereas Stenopus hispidus, Gnathophylloides mineri and Parribacus antarcticus are disjunct circumtropical species as their distribution in the Atlantic Ocean is limited eastwardly to TMV or Ascension Island (S. hispidus), therefore, do not extending into the eastern Atlantic. Gnathophyllum circellum and Thor manningi are western Atlantic species, with G. circellum previously known only from the Caribbean Sea. Pontonia manningi, Tuleariocaris neglecta and Enoplometopus antillensis are amphi-Atlantic in distribution. Two of the above species are recorded from the southwestern Atlantic for the first time: Gnathophyllum circellum and Tuleariocaris neglecta. These new records corroborate that the marine benthic invertebrate fauna of the TMV archipelago is actually a mosaic of amphi-Atlantic, eastern Atlantic, central Atlantic (insular), endemic and circumtropical species, with a strong western Atlantic component.",NA,NA,NA,

LARGE-SCALE BEDFORMS CONSIST OF I BIOCLASTIC  MAINLY CORALLINE ALGAE AND HALIMEDA SAND RIBBONS 5-10 KM LONG 50-600  M WIDE PARALLEL TO THE SHORELINE AND II VERY LARGE TRANSVERSE  SILICICLASTIC DUNES 3.4 KM LONG ON AVERAGE 840 M SPACING AND 3-8 M  HIGH WITH TROUGHS THAT GRADE RAPIDLY INTO CARBONATE SANDS AND GRAVELS.  WAVE RIPPLES ARE SUPERPOSED ON ALL LARGE-SCALE BEDFORMS AND INDICATE AN  ONSHORE SHELF SEDIMENT TRANSPORT NORMAL TO THE MAIN SEDIMENT TRANSPORT  DIRECTION. THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE LARGE-SCALE BEDFORMS IS PRIMARILY  DETERMINED BY THE NORTHWESTERLY FLOWING RESIDUAL OCEANIC AND TIDAL  CURRENTS RESULTING MAINLY IN COAST-PARALLEL TRANSPORT. MODELS OF SHELF  BEDFORM FORMATION PREDICT SAND RIBBONS TO OCCUR IN HIGHER ENERGY  SETTINGS RATHER THAN IN LARGE DUNES. HOWEVER IN THE STUDY AREA SAND  RIBBONS OCCUR IN AN AREA OF COARSE LOW-DENSITY AND EASILY TRANSPORTABLE  BIOCLASTIC SANDS AND GRAVELS COMPARED WITH THE VERY LARGE TRANSVERSE  DUNES IN AN OFFSHORE AREA THAT IS COMPOSED OF DENSER MEDIUM-GRAINED  SILICICLASTIC SANDS. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF DIFFERENT  SEDIMENT TYPES IS LIKELY TO EXERT AN INFLUENCE ON THE NATURE OF THE  BEDFORMS GENERATED. THE OFFSHORE SAND SUPPLY IS TIME LIMITED AND  ORIGINATES FROM SEA FLOOR EROSION OF SANDSTONES OF FORMER SEA-LEVEL  LOWSTANDS. THE TROUGH AREAS OF BOTH SAND RIBBONS AND VERY LARGE  TRANSVERSE DUNES COMPRISE COARSE CALCAREOUS ALGAL GRAVELS THAT SUPPORT  BENTHIC COMMUNITIES OF VARIABLE MATURITY. DIVERSE MATURE COMMUNITIES  RESULT IN SEDIMENT STABILIZATION THROUGH BRANCHING ALGAL GROWTH AND  BINDING THAT IS THOUGHT TO MODIFY THE MORPHOLOGY OF DUNES AND SAND  RIBBONS.

This area has attracted the attention of biologists because of its peculiar mushroom-shaped structures, locally known as ‚Äúchapeir√µes‚Äù, and endemic species of corals and other organisms. The macrophytobenthos compartment plays an important ecological role in the functioning of the bank, and some reports on the presence of seaweeds and seagrasses have been published; however, the data are fragmentary, and a more detailed survey of the macrophytobenthos compartment is lacking. Here we consolidate the information available and add new data obtained from two expeditions focused on seaweed and seagrass diversity from two sectors of the bank: the islands of the Abrolhos archipelago (AA) and the Sebasti√£o Gomes Reef (SG). These sites were selected for their contrasting characteristics. Specifically, SG (15 km off the mouth of the Caravelas River) is subjected to a broader range of anthropogenic impacts and to input of terrigenous sediments, while the AA (54 km offshore) is surrounded by calcareous biogenic sediments, has clearer water and is less affected by human activities. Macrophytobenthic species richness on both reference areas is larger than previously thought. Considering previous records, there are 164 species of macrophytes in AA and 111 species in SG, of which 59 and 74 species are first records for each respective location. The higher species richness at the AA may result from a higher habitat complexity and lower turbidity, but a potential negative effect of enhanced human impacts at SG cannot be ruled out. Considering that macroalgae are relevant components of the benthic community, as producers and structurer organisms, the data presented herein provide a reliable baseline for future environmental studies, and thus may contribute to improve management policies within the unique ecosystem of Abrolhos.",UNIV SAO PAULO,"TORRANO-SILVA, BN (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SAO PAULO, INST BIOCIENCIAS, DEPT BOT, BR-05422970 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIORCOORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR (CAPES); CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO (CNPQ),

Rhodoliths are unattached, branching, crustose benthic marine red algae; they provide habitat for a rich variety of marine invertebrates. The resultant excavation is relevant to sediment production, while is common that the fragments or the whole specimens result in vast fossil deposits formed by rich material that can be ‚Äúmined‚Äù for biological and geological data. Accordingly, microtomography (ŒºCT) may enable a detailed investigation of biological and geological signatures preserved within the rhodolith structure in a non-destructive approach that is especially relevant when analyzing herbaria collections or rare samples. Therefore, we prepared coralline algae samples and submitted them to a range of capabilities provided by the SkyScan1176 micro-CT scanner, including reconstruction, virtual slicing, and pinpointing biological and geological signatures. To this end, polychaetes and mollusk shells, or their excavations, coral nucleation, sediment deposits and conceptacles were all observed. Although a similar technique has been applied previously to samples of living rhodoliths in Brazil, we show, for the first time, its successful application to fossil rhodoliths.

This zone has an important ecological role, due to its mangroves and its location, next to Abrolhos coral reef, the most important one in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Concerning this study, some traditional parameters parameters (temperature, conductivity, salinity) were used to understand the physical properties, as well as some different ones like: dissolved oxygen, turbidity, suspended solids and nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, nitrite and phosphorus), in order to understand the hydrochemical dynamics of this estuary. Two surveys were done (Winter/2000 and Summer/2001) during different tide conditions (falling and rising). The chemical patterns analyzed in situ, allowed us to classify such water as ""typically coastal"" (tropical water from Brazil's stream), influenced by some freshwater. Caravelas estuary behaves like a typical tide channel, influenced by coastal water. The ""shallow"" coastal water of the Brazilian eastern shelf is typically lack of nutrients (due to the influence of the Brazilian Current) and it receives organic material from small rivers/mangroves systems like Caravelas estuary. During the two surveys, the nutrients' level remained in the same range and with a similar spatial spread. Higher levels were reported on the inner estuary, in both seasons, showing the influence of the mangrove system, and decreased to seaward. The levels reported on the area are typical, and in Caravelas zone the material turbidity has a major role on the fertilization of the surrounding areas",MP (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),"TRAVASSOS, MP (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CEPEMAR ENVIRONM COMSULTING SERV, BR-29050650 VITORIA, BRAZIL",NA,

IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE ESTABLISHED THE  COMPOSITION OF THE A. BRASILIENSIS MICROBIOME AND THE METABOLIC PATHWAYS  ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COMMUNITY. WE USED 454 SHOTGUN PYROSEQUENCING TO  GENERATE APPROXIMATELY 640000 HIGH-QUALITY SPONGE-DERIVED SEQUENCES  SIMILAR TO 150 MB. CLUSTERING ANALYSIS INCLUDING SPONGE SEAWATER AND  TWENTY-THREE OTHER METAGENOMES DERIVED FROM MARINE ANIMAL MICROBIOMES  SHOWS THAT A. BRASILIENSIS CONTAINS A SPECIFIC MICROBIOME. FOURTEEN  BACTERIAL PHYLA INCLUDING PROTEOBACTERIA CYANOBACTERIA  ACTINOBACTERIA BACTEROIDETES FIRMICUTES AND CLOROFLEXI WERE  CONSISTENTLY FOUND IN THE A. BRASILIENSIS METAGENOMES. THE A.

NORTHERN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ZONES OF THE AMAZON  RIVER MOUTH WERE SAMPLED BETWEEN WATER-DEPTHS OF 23 AND 120 M COVERING  A CONTINENTAL SHELF AREA OF 9500 KM2 TO CHARACTERIZE THE STRUCTURE  AND COMPOSITION OF RHODOLITHS ALONG DEPTH GRADIENTS AND RELATED RIVER  PLUME INFLUENCE. THE DEEPEST RHODOLITHS CONSIST OF A THIN  ALGAL/BRYOZOAN/ENCRUSTING FORAMINIFER COVER AROUND RELATIVELY LARGE  NUCLEI THAT DETERMINE THE NODULE SIZE AND SHAPE. AT 120-M DEPTH IN THE  NORTHERN ZONE THE NUCLEI ARE MADE OF FRAGMENTS OF INVERTEBRATE  BOUNDSTONE OR OOLITE RUDSTONE WHEREAS AT 100-M DEPTH IN THE CENTRAL  ZONE THE NUCLEI CONSIST OF SANDSTONE CLASTS. IN BOTH CASES THE NUCLEI  ARE FRAGMENTS OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS THAT ACCUMULATED ON THE OUTER SHELF  DURING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SEA LEVEL. LOW-LIGHT LEVELS PREVENT  SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH OF THE ALGAL COVER AROUND THE NUCLEI. REDUCED  ILLUMINATION AN D HIGH NUTRIENT LEVELS LED TO THE COMPOSITION OF  RHODOLITHS AT 95-M DEPTH IN THE NORTHERN ZONE PREDOMINANTLY BUILT BY  BRYOZOANS WITH SUBORDINATE CORALLINE ALGAE AROUND SMALL BIOCLASTIC  NUCLEI. IN THE CENTRAL ZONE AT 50-55 M DEPTHS CORALLINE ALGAE ARE THE  MAIN COMPONENTS OF MOSTLY SUB-SPHEROIDAL RHODOLITHS. THEY HAVE  RELATIVELY RECENT AGES OF HUNDREDS OF YEARS OR SHOW TWO PHASES OF GROWTH  WITH THE OLDER PHASE BEGINNING 1300 YEARS AGO AND THEN BEING INTERRUPTED  FROM ABOUT 1000 YEARS BP TO 600 YEARS BP. ALL THIS SUGGESTS RELATIVELY  HIGH BURIAL RATES DUE TO SEDIMENT FLUX CHANGING IN TIME TO FAVOR  EXHUMATION AFTER BURIAL IN SOME INSTANCES. THE RHODOLITHS FROM 23 M IN  THE SOUTHERN ZONE ARE GROWING UNDER A LOW INFLUENCE OF THE RIVER PLUME  AND HAVE THE HIGHEST DIVERSITY OF CORALLINE ALGAE AND OTHER BUILDERS.

Cultures of these bacterial symbionts produced strong antioxidant activity (catalase, peroxidase, and oxidase). To explore these bacterial isolates further, we identified their major pigments by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The six phylogenetically diverse symbionts had similar pigment patterns and produced myxol and keto-carotene. In addition, similar carotenoid gene clusters were confirmed in the whole genome sequences of these symbionts, which reinforce their antioxidant potential.

An instrument that can be used to halt threats to these ecosystems is environmental education (and one of the best places to use it is at school), but environmental perception studies must be first carried out to portray the target group. This study aimed to analyze the perception of students of the Metropolitan Area of Recife (Brazil) on the elements that characterize the importance of reef environments, as well as to evaluate educational tools that would be efficient in promoting awareness about this theme. To achieve this goal, questionnaires were applied to two grades of three public and three private schools before and after an educational intervention based on 291-strong sample analyzed. The questionnaire included ten items that collected the students‚Äô basic data, as well as several aspects on reef environments. In addition, teachers of those grades were interviewed. There were no differences in knowledge between the two types of school; before the intervention, the understanding of the theme was in general poorly constructed in all of the schools studied.

Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia 41 (1889) 102] has a widespread distribution over the Western Atlantic, where it has been reported from Bermuda and Bahamas to southern Brazil. Nonetheless, reproductive features of this species, which broods asexually produced offspring, suggest that it has low dispersal capabilities. This raises a question about the specific status of the Brazilian population of A. bermudensis. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the taxonomic status of the Brazilian population, by genetically comparing it with the type locality (Bermuda) population. For this, we used allozyme electrophoresis to analyze samples from both populations. Thirteen enzyme systems (16 loci) yielded interpretable results for all populations. A high differentiation was encountered for the Western Atlantic A. bermudensis population (FST=0.434), partially due to the presence of a diagnostic locus (LAP) between Bermuda and Brazilian populations. This result could be taken as an indication that the Brazilian population should be elevated to a specific status. We do expect some genetic differentiation, however, between natural populations separated over wide geographic distances. Finally, since Mantel and regression analyses did not rule out the isolation by distance model, we have conservatively decided to maintain the specific status of A. bermudensis from Brazil.",UNIV FED RIO DE JANEIRO,"RUSSO, CAM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FED RIO DE JANEIRO, CCS, DEPT GENET,INST BIOL, LAB BIODIVERSIDADE MOL, BLOCO A,CIDADE UNIV, BR-21941590 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL",NA,

USING A SESSILE MARINE  COMMUNITY WE CONDUCTED A MANIPULATIVE EXPERIMENT TO MEASURE THE EFFECT  OF TIMING AND EXTENT OF PREDATOR EXPOSURE. EVERY MONTH OVER A 5 MONTH  PERIOD WE ASSESSED TAXA COMPOSITION DOMINANCE AND TAXA RICHNESS IN EACH  OF THE FOLLOWING FIVE TREATMENTS 1 NEVER PREDATED 2 ALWAYS PREDATED  3 EARLY PREDATED DURING THE FIRST MONTH OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 4  LATE PREDATED AND 5 UNCAGED PANELS. PREDATION WAS VERY IMPORTANT IN  DETERMINING TAXA IDENTITY AND DOMINANCE REDUCING SPATIAL MONOPOLIZATION  BY ASCIDIANS AND INCREASING THE AREA OCCUPIED BY BRYOZOANS BUT OVERALL  PREDATION DID NOT RESULT IN A MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITY. THE LOCALIZED  EXTINCTION OF ASCIDIANS IN PREDATION TREATMENTS WAS COMPENSATED BY AN  INCREASE IN THE DIVERSITY OF BRYOZOANS AND BARNACLES. INTERESTINGLY  PREDATION DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HAD ONLY  SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON THE TAXA RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION. AFTER 5 MONTHS  PREDATOR EXCLUSION DURING THE EARLY LIFE-HISTORY STAGES HAD NO EFFECT ON  COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND ONLY CURRENT LEVELS OF PREDATION DETERMINED  DIFFERENCES IN COMPOSITION. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT PREDATION CAN CAUSE  CHANGES IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY WITHOUT  NECESSARY CHANGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CO-OCCURRING TAXA. MORE  IMPORTANT WE DEMONSTRATE TO OUR STUDY SYSTEM THAT ALTHOUGH PREDATION  DURING THE EARLY LIFE-HISTORY STAGES CAN BE STRONG AND HAVE IMPORTANT  SHORT-TERM EFFECTS PREDATION DURING THE ADULT STAGES DETERMINES  LONG-TERM COMMUNITY COMPOSITION.

CONSUMER EFFECTS WERE NOT GENERAL  DEPENDING ON BOTH SITE AND SUCCESSIONAL STAGE. DURING EARLY SUCCESSION  AND AT SITES WHERE BARE SPACE WAS PROMPTLY OCCUPIED PREDATION DID NOT  REDUCE SPECIES RICHNESS PROBABLY BECAUSE SETTLEMENT OF A DIVERSE  SPECIES POOL WAS INTENSE.

IN GENERAL THE MIXED SHELF  SEDIMENTATION MODEL SHOWS A CROSS-SHELF GRADIENT FROM TERRIGENOUS TO  CARBONATE SEDIMENTS OR A SHIFT FROM THE CONTINENTAL SHELF TO THE BASIN.  HERE WE USE ACOUSTIC SEABED MAPPING SURFACE SEDIMENT SAMPLING AND  HIGH-RESOLUTION SEABED VIDEOS TO REPORT THE COEVAL OCCURRENCE OF  BIOGENIC REEFS RHODOLITH BEDS AND RIVER DELTAS ALONG THE SOUTHEAST-EAST  BRAZILIAN SHELF. THIS INVESTIGATION DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF COMBINED  ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS SUCH AS SHELF WIDTH SEDIMENT INPUT SOURCES  MESOSCALE CIRCULATION AND SEALEVEL CHANGES IN CONTROLLING  MIXED-SEDIMENT DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS. IN THE STUDY AREA SHELF WIDTH  VARIES FROM 40 TO 200 KM THE RIO DOCE IS THE MAJOR SEDIMENT INPUT  SOURCE THE BRAZIL CURRENT PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE ALONG THE SHELF  EDGE AND UPWELLING PROCESSES ARE REPORTED WITHIN THIS AREA. RESULTS  SHOW THAT A TRANSITION FROM TERRIGENOUS TO CARBONATE SEDIMENTS CAN OCCUR  LATERALLY OR ALONG-SHELF I.E. TERRIGENOUS AND CARBONATE SEDIMENTS  COEXIST ALONG THE SAME WATER DEPTH RANGE. IN NARROW MIXED CONTINENTAL  SHELVES A STRONG LATERAL/LATITUDINAL CHANGE IN THE SEDIMENTARY DOMAINS  CAN BE OBSERVED DUE TO LATERAL VARIATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS SUCH  AS SEDIMENT INPUT AND CARBONATE PRODUCTION. WIDER CONTINENTAL SHELVES  TEND TO DISPLAY A GREATER MIXING TRANSITION ZONE ACROSS THE DEPTH  GRADIENT. THE COEXISTENCE OF REEF BEDS WITH TERRIGENOUS-DERIVED  SEDIMENTATION IS THE PRODUCT OF DIFFERENT TEMPORAL SCALES OF GEOLOGICAL  AND OCEANOGRAPHIC PROCESSES. THE ORIGIN AND FORMATION OF THE MAIN FACIES  ARE RELATED TO THE LAST DEGLACIATION PERIOD BUT MODERN SEDIMENT INPUT  AND OCEANOGRAPHIC PROCESSES SEASONAL UPWELLING ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS  TO TERRIGENOUS AND CARBONATE SEDIMENTATION PATTERNS.

VOLK DR 2020 J BIOGEOG,2020,Going against the flow: Barriers to gene flow impact patterns of connectivity in cryptic coral reef gobies throughout the western Atlantic,{Brazil; Caribbean; Coryphopterus; cryptic species; marine speciation,"Aim Complex oceanographic features have historically caused difficulty in understanding gene flow in marine taxa. Here, we evaluate the impact of potential phylogeographic barriers to gene flow and assess demography and evolutionary history of a coral reef goby species complex. Specifically, we test how the Amazon River outflow and ocean currents impact gene flow. Location Western Atlantic. Taxon The bridled goby (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum) and sand-canyon goby (C. venezuelae) species complex. Methods We used mitochondrial DNA and 2,401 genomic SNPs to investigate evolutionary history and test hypotheses of how major barriers impact species-level differentiation. We used clustering algorithms and pairwise F-ST to assess population differentiation caused by minor barriers within and among regions. Finally, we tested alternate hypotheses of demographic history via coalescent simulations to determine the most plausible spread across the Western Atlantic. Results We found two unique clades of C. glaucofraenum along the Brazilian coast and the oceanic island Atol das Rocas (AR) that are more closely related to C. venzuelae. Further genetic structure within the Caribbean and separately along the Brazilian coast led to at least two distinct populations in each Province. Coalescent simulations indicated that an ancestral population of C. venezuelae split from C. glaucofraenum in the Caribbean, dispersed to Brazil, then spread to AR. Main conclusions Species-level genetic differentiation has resulted from the Amazon River outflow and isolation of AR. Population differentiation within the Caribbean matched previous studies indicating an east-west pattern of divergence. Brazilian population differentiation was impacted by the cold-water upwelling filter at Cabo Frio. Overall, this research highlights how barriers to gene flow impact speciation and genetic structure within western Atlantic gobies and provides insight into the role oceanographic features have in the speciation process of fishes",NA,NA,NA,

NEWBORN SHARKS 60 TO 80 CM TOTAL LENGTH  TL SHOWED RESTRICTED BUT REPEATED MOVEMENTS BETWEEN SMALL TIDE POOLS ON  REEF FLATS AT LOW TIDE AND A SMALL SHALLOW NEARBY TIDAL CREEK AT HIGH  TIDE. LARGER SHARKS UP TO 106 CM TL SAMPLED 6 AND 20 MO AFTER THE  STUDY IN MARCH 2000 FREQUENTED THE TIDAL CREEK AND SEVERAL OTHER  LOCATIONS AT HIGH TIDE AND A VARIETY OF LARGER POOLS AT LOW TIDE AND IN  GENERAL EXHIBITED MORE EXTENSIVE MOVEMENTS WITHIN THE ATOLL THAN DID  NEWBORN SHARKS. SHARKS APPROACHING 2 YR OF AGE WERE GENERALLY OBSERVED  IN SPECIFIC POOLS OR SHALLOW WATER LOCATIONS WITHIN THE ATOLL DURING  HIGH AND LOW TIDES BUT ALSO EXPANDED THEIR MOVEMENTS TO INCLUDE MORE OF  THE ATOLL. THROUGHOUT THE STUDY YOUNG LEMON SHARKS APPEARED TO  CONCENTRATE MOVEMENTS WITHIN SHALLOW-WATER LOW-TIDE REFUGES AND SEPARATE  HIGH TIDAL AREAS. MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF SHARKS IN ATOL DAS ROCAS DIFFER  FROM THOSE AT OTHER WELL-STUDIED LEMON SHARK NURSERY LOCATIONS WHERE  INDIVIDUALS CONTINUOUSLY OCCUPY SHALLOW FLATS AND MANGROVE HABITATS.  NEVERTHELESS LEMON SHARKS IN GENERAL RESTRICT THEIR MOVEMENTS TO  SHALLOW-WATER HABITATS REGARDLESS OF THE SPECIFIC NURSERY AREA OCCUPIED.  THIS BEHAVIOR IS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO PREDATOR AVOIDANCE.

XAVIER JHA 2012 NEOTROP ICHTHY,2012,"Fish assemblage of the Mamanguape Environmental Protection Area, NE Brazil: abundance, composition and microhabitat availability along the mangrove-reef gradient ","Conservation, Conservation unit, Ichthyofauna, Nursery habitats. ","Reefs, mangroves and seagrass biotopes often occur in close association, forming a complex and highly productive ecosystem that provide significant ecologic and economic goods and services. Different anthropogenic disturbances are increasingly affecting these tropical coastal habitats leading to growing conservation concern. In this field-based study, we used a visual census technique (belt transects 50 m x 2 m) to investigate the interactions between fishes and microhabitats at the Mamanguape Mangrove-Reef system, NE Brazil. Overall, 144 belt transects were performed from October 2007 to September 2008 to assess the structure of the fish assemblage. Fish trophic groups and life stage (juveniles and adults) were recorded according to literature, the percent cover of the substrate was estimated using the point contact method. Our results revealed that fish composition gradually changed from the Estuarine to the Reef zone, and that fish assemblage was strongly related to the microhabitat availability, as suggested by the predominance of carnivores at the Estuarine zone and presence of herbivores at the Reef zone. Fish abundance and diversity were higher in the Reef zone and estuary margins, highlighting the importance of structural complexity. A pattern of nursery area utilization, with larger specimens at the Transition and Reef Zone and smaller individuals at the Estuarine zone, was recorded for Abudefduf saxatilis, Anisotremus surinamensis, Lutjanus alexandrei, and Lutjanus jocu. Our findings clearly suggests ecosystem connectivity between mangrove, seagrass and reef biotopes, and highlighted the importance of Mamanguape Mangrove-Reef System as a priority area for conservation and research, whose habitat mosaics should be further studied and protected.",NA,NA,NA,
