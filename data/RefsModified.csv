We searched global, national and local threatened species lists for Brazilian reef fish species and compared the differences between them with respect to categories and criteria applied. Of 559 Brazilian reef fish species, 125 have been evaluated against threat criteria at different scales; a total of 43 are listed as threatened with extinction. Of 43 threatened species, 32 are mentioned in the global IUCN Red List, 11 are referred to in the national inventory, and state lists also cite 11. Six endemic species are threatened; of these, 3 are listed by the IUCN, 5 at the national level and 2 are threatened in Esp�rito Santo state. This highlights a mismatch between species lists: 84.8% of the species listed as globally threatened do not appear in the national list, whereas 54.5% of the species mentioned on the Brazilian list are not in the IUCN Red List. Moreover, we found disagreements in the set of categories and criteria applied in the different red listing processes. The same categories and quantitative criteria must be applied in all regional red lists, so that conservation actions are more effective and lists are trustworthy. This is imperative to attract financial support for threatened species management and recovery. Management plans must be developed for those species already listed as threatened in Brazil. In addition, a review of the national list and the inclusion of threatened Brazilian endemic fishes in the IUCN Red List are needed.",,"Mismatches between global, national and local red lists and their consequences for Brazilian reef fish conservation",10.3354/esr00449,Bender,Endangered Species Research,1,1

Recruitment . Benthic complexity . Predation . SW Atlantic,"Branching scleractinians provide fish with critical refuge against predation. While in the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific regions they are conspicuous elements of the reef community, in the tropical Southwestern Atlantic (Brazil) branching corals are lacking and massive forms dominate. The only branching forms that occur in Brazil are stinging fire-corals of genus Millepora (Hydrozoa). Preliminary observations showed that several fish species seek refuge within fire-corals in Brazil, suggesting that they may replace the functional role played by scleractinians in other regions. Here, the association of fishes to individual fire-coral colonies (Millepora alcicornis and M. brasiliensis) and the relationship between fire-coral cover and fish abundance was studied in eastern Brazil. A total of 38 fish species from 18 families (37 % of the regional species pool) were recorded within firecorals. Most records were of relatively small-bodied fishes and juveniles of large-bodied fishes. Comparative observations between day and night indicated that fire-corals are used as sleeping sites by a few species. Volume of colonies was positively correlated with fish abundance and species richness. Over a large spatial scale (tens of kilometers) fire-coral cover had a positive and significant influence on the abundance of three fish species only (Abudefduf saxatilis, Acanthurus coeruleus and Microspatodon chrysurus). Although physical attributes of colonies and fire-coral cover may help to account for some of the spatial variability in fish abundance, fire-corals may be considered as an alternative instead of a critical microhabitat for fish. The advantages and drawbacks of living in a branching and stinging environment are discussed.",,"An evaluation of the use of branching fire-corals (Millepora spp.) as refuge by reef fish in the Abrolhos Bank, eastern Brazil",10.1007/s10641-012-0021-6,Coni,Environmental Biology of Fishes,1,1

CLUSTER SIMILARITY BETWEEN 180 REEF PROFILES  INDICATES THAT IN 75\% OF THE AREA THE REEF GEOMETRY HAS A  CONFIGURATION SIMILAR TO A PLATFORM REEF WHEREAS IN 25\% OF THE AREA IT  RESEMBLES A FRINGING REEF. MEASUREMENTS OF WAVE PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS  WERE MADE AT TWO STATIONS EXPERIMENTS E1 AND E2 ACROSS THE REEF  PROFILE. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT WAVE HEIGHT WAS TIDALLY MODULATED AT  BOTH EXPERIMENTAL SITES. UP TO 67\% E1 AND 99.9\% E2 OF THE INCIDENT  WAVE HEIGHT IS ATTENUATED BY THE REEF TOP AT LOW TIDE. THIS TIDAL  MODULATION IS MOST APPARENT AT E2 DUE TO REEF GEOMETRY.

587,EDWARDS A 1983-a,1983,THE ECOLOGY OF SAINT PAUL'S ROCKS (EQUATORIAL ATLANTIC),,"St Paul's Rocks are a remote group of islets, barely 400 m across, in the equatorial midAtlantic ( 0 3 5 'N 29'2 I 'W). The results of a primarily zoological survey of the Rocks, carried out in September 1979 by the Cambridge Expedition to Saint Paul's Rocks, are reported. In addition, earlier studies of the Rocks'biology are discussed in the light of recent research. The terrestrial fauna is dominated by three species of sea-bird and a land crab. Also reported from on land are a few species of insects, ticks and spiders, an endemic pseudoscorpion, and a centipede; the majority of these species are associated with the seabirds. The islets are devoid of tracheophytes, bryophytes and lichens. The marine ecology of the Rocks is discussed with respect to habitat. Five habitats are distinguished in the supralittoral and littoral zones; the fauna and to a limited extent the flora of each is described. Sublittorally the Rocks consist almost entirely of steep escarpments extending to 60 m depth and beyond. The shallow sublittoral ( < 60 m deep) is divided into four habitats: ( I ) Palythoa zone; (2) Caulerpa zone; (3) sub-Caulerpa zone, and (4) areas of unstable substrates. The Pnlythoa zone occupies a band extending from the base of the littoral to a depth of c. 5 m and is dominated by a mat-forming hexacoral, Palythoa caribaeorum. Below this zone to a depth of c. 33 m the rock faces are thickly invested by a species of green-alga, Caulerpa racemosa. At depth this Caulerpa dominated zone is succeeded by an invertebrate dominated community. Unstable substrates are represented by a few pockets of coarse sand and some patches of rubble. The communities in each of these habitats are described. A primarily taxonomic review of the deep-water fauna is also included. Finally, the influence of ocean currents on the zoogeographical relationships of the Rocks' fauna is briefly examined.",,The ecology of Saint Paul's Rocks (Equatorial Atlantic),10.1111/j.1469-7998.1983.tb06108.x,Edwards,Journal of Zoology,1,1
588,EDWARDS A 1983,1983,Marine zoogeography of St Paul's Rocks,BIOGEOGRAPHY,"The zoogeographical relationships of the shallow water marine fauna of St Paul's Rocks (equatorial Atlantic) are examined with respect to ocean current patterns. Of seventy-seven benthic species considered, 46% are amphi-Atlantic, 14% occur at the central Atlantic islands of Ascension and/or St Helena as well as in either the eastern or western Atlantic, and 5% are endemic to the Rocks. Of the remaining twenty-seven species, 74% are shared only with the western Atlantic, 15% only with Ascension/St Helena, and 11% only with the eastern Atlantic. We deduce that the primary route of immigration for shallow water benthic species has been from Brazil, via the Atlantic Equatorial Undercurrent. Some input from Ascension Island and West Africa by means of the South Equatorial Current is also indicated. The zoogeographical composition of the St Paul's fauna is discussed in relation to current velccities and larval lifetimes. We conclude that St Paul's is essentially ail impoverished oceanic outpost of the Brazilian faunal province.",,Marine Zoogeography of St Paul's Rocks,10.2307/2844583,Edwards,Journal of Biogeography,1,1
594,ENDO CAK 2019 SCIENT REP,2019,Low connectivity compromises the conservation of reef fishes by marine protected areas in the tropical south Atlantic,,"the total spatial coverage of Marine protected Areas (MpA) within the Brazilian economic exclusive Zone (EEZ) has recently achieved the quantitative requirement of the Aichii Biodiversity Target 11. However, the distribution of MpA in the Brazilian eeZ is still unbalanced regarding the proportion of protected ecosystems, protection goals and management types. Moreover, the demographic connectivity between these MPA and their effectiveness regarding the maintenance of biodiversity are still not comprehensively understood. An individual-based modeling scheme coupled with a regional hydrodynamic model of the ocean is used to determine the demographic connectivity of reef fishes based on the widespread genus Sparisoma found in the oceanic islands and on the Brazilian continental shelf between 10� N and 23� S. Model results indicate that MPA are highly isolated due to extremely low demographic connectivity. Consequently, low connectivity and the long distances separating MPA contribute to their isolation. Therefore, the current MPA design falls short of its goal of maintaining the demographic connectivity of Sparisoma populations living within these areas. In an extreme scenario in which the MpA rely solely on protected populations for recruits, it is unlikely that they will be able to effectively contribute to the resilience of these populations or other reef fish species sharing the same dispersal abilities. Results also show that recruitment occurs elsewhere along the continental shelf indicating that the protection of areas larger than the current MpA would enhance the network, maintain connectivity and contribute to the conservation of reef fishes.",,Low connectivity compromises the conservation of reef fishes by marine protected areas in the tropical South Atlantic,10.1038/s41598-019-45042-0,Endo,Scientific Reports,1,1

Above 50 mm, the proportion of red males increased in the population, indicating that functional maturity is also related to colour pattern.

In this study, I examine the cues used by followers to find nuclear fish. A model of a ubiquitous nuclear fish was maintained immobile or moved to disturb the substratum and the number of fish species and individuals attracted was compared to control treatments. The results showed that: 1) bottom disturbance was the strongest attraction factor for follower reef fishes; 2) visual features of the nuclear also attracted follower reef fishes; 3) there was no evidence of an interaction between bottom disturbance and nuclear fish appearance in the attraction of followers, supporting the idea that both factors independently elicit following behaviour by reef fishes.",KRAJEWSKI JP 2009 ENVIRON BIOL FISHES,How do follower reef fishes find nuclear fishes?,10.1007/s10641-009-9533-0,Krajewski,Environmental Biology of Fishes,1,1

Here, we analyse how traits related to the pelagic dispersal and adult biology of 985 tropical reef fish species correlate with their establishing populations on both sides of two Atlantic marine barriers: the Mid-Atlantic Barrier (MAB) and the Amazon-Orinoco Plume (AOP). Generalized linear mixed-effects models indicate that predictors for successful barrier crossing are the ability to raft with flotsam for the deep-water MAB, non-reef habitat usage for the freshwater and sediment-rich AOP, and large adult-size and large latitudinal-range for both barriers. Variation in larval-development mode, often thought to be broadly related to larval-dispersal potential, is not a significant predictor in either case. Many more species of greater taxonomic diversity cross the AOP than the MAB. Rafters readily cross both barriers but represent a much smaller proportion of AOP crossers than MAB crossers. Successful establishment after crossing both barriers may be facilitated by broad environmental tolerance associated with large body size and wide latitudinal-range. These results highlight the need to look beyond larval-dispersal potential and assess adult-biology traits when assessing determinants of successful movements across marine barriers.",LUIZ OJ 2012 PROC B,Ecological traits influencing range expansion across large oceanic dispersal barriers: insights from tropical Atlantic reef fishes,10.1098/rspb.2011.1525,Luiz,Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,1,1

A gap analysis was conducted to evaluate how well marine protected areas (MPAs) in Brazil meet conservation objectives for representation, connectivity, and risk-spreading. The performance of the MPAs was evaluated by overlaying maps of ecosystem and management and calculating the size of no-take areas and the distances between them. All objectives were far from fully attained. Currently, the protection of the marine environment is poor, with less than 1.9% of Brazil's marine jurisdiction within MPAs and 0.14% within no-take areas. Also, only 23% of the ecosystems met the minimal number of replicates required by the risk-spreading objective. More positively, just over half (51%) of the no-take areas are a desirable distance apart. Our study highlights that a systematic expansion of MPAs in Brazil is urgently needed to move toward an ecologically representative and functioning MPA system",,Analysis of Progress Towards a Comprehensive System of Marine Protected Areas in Brazil,10.4322/natcon.2013.013,Magris,Natureza & Conservação,1,1

Pelagic clusters ? Invasive species ? Propagule dispersal,"We report that planulae produced by Tubastraea coccinea can metamorphose and aggregate in groups of up to eight polyps in the water column, without previous settlement on benthic substrate. We also evaluated the survival of propagules to test whether different levels of aggregation allowed for longer planktonic life and, therefore, higher dispersal potential. Our results show that pelagic polyps live longer than planulae, probably because they can feed and meet the presumably high-energy demands of swimming. Clusters of two or more individuals lived longer than solitary polyps. However, mortality did not differ between small (2-3 polyps) and large (4-8 polyps) clusters, suggesting the existence of an upper limit to cluster size. Most swimming clusters (80 %) remained alive after 6 months, suggesting that pelagic metamorphosis and cluster formation can be a key life-history feature increasing dispersal potential, population connectivity, and the colonization of new habitats in this invasive species.",,Groups travel further: pelagic metamorphosis and polyp clustering allow higher dispersal potential in sun coral propagules,10.1007/s00338-014-1135-4,Mizrahi,Coral Reefs,1,1

This study investigated public perception at a coastal town in Brazil. Individuals were asked to respond to specific questions concerning their knowledge, perception, and behaviour regarding corals. Although more interviewees believed they knew what the photograph of a gorgonian was, the stony coral pictures were identified correctly more frequently. Interviewees sometimes thought that the gorgonian was a plant, whereas stony corals were frequently identified as sponges, sea urchins or stones. Interviewees related the word ""coral"" to words such as alive, sea, plant, rock, animal, hurt, calcareous and jewellery. Moreover, interviewees intended to buy or collect corals no matter whether they knew what they were. This study revealed that people living, working and holidaying in a coastal town in Brazil have a poor understanding of corals.",OIGMAN-PSZCZOL SS 2007 CORAL REEFS,Perceptions of coral in a coastal tourist town in Brazil,10.1007/s00338-007-0239-5,Oigman-Pszczol,Coral Reefs,1,1

SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE ACOUSTICALLY  MAPPED RHODOLITH BEDS AS A HOMOGENEOUS HABITAT BUT SPATIAL CHANGES IN  NODULE COVERAGE OR DENSITY COMMONLY OCCUR. HERE THE OBJECTIVE IS TO  ACOUSTICALLY RECOGNIZE HETEROGENEITIES IN RHODOLITH BED STRUCTURE USING  THE RESPONSE OF BACKSCATTER TO MAP CHANGES IN NODULE COVERAGE AND  DENSITY. HIGH-RESOLUTION MULTIBEAM SONAR MBSS DATA WERE ACQUIRED ON  APRIL 2018 IN THE MARINE PROTECTION AREA MPA COSTAS DAS ALGAS  LOCATED IN THE ESPIRITO SANTO CONTINENTAL SHELF EASTERN BRAZILIAN  COAST. THREE AREAS WERE SELECTED BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA TOTALIZING  73KM2 OF DATA ACQUISITION. GROUND TRUTH WAS OBTAINED AT 80 STATIONS  USING A DROP CAMERA SYSTEM. SEABED CLASSIFICATION WAS DETERMINED BY  APPLYING AN IMAGE SEGMENTATION PROCESS ON MULTIBEAM SONAR BACKSCATTER  MOSAIC. GROUND TRUTH DATA WAS USED TO STATISTICALLY SHOW THE RELATION  BETWEEN BACKSCATTER AND SEABED TYPES. RESULTS IDENTIFIED THREE CLASSES  RELATED TO RHODOLITHS IN DIFFERENT COVERAGE DENSITIES LOW RHODOLITH  COVERAGE INFERIOR TO 25\% OF RHODOLITHS OVER A DETERMINED AREA  MODERATE RHODOLITH COVERAGE BETWEEN 25\% AND 35\% OF RHODOLITHS AND  HIGH RHODOLITH COVERAGE > 35\%. CLASSES ASSOCIATED WITH SEDIMENT  BIOCONCRETIONS AND RED ALGAE GENUS PEYSSONELIAS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED. A  MAP SHOWING CHANGES IN RHODOLITH COVERAGE ACROSS THE SHELF DEPTH  GRADIENT WERE PRODUCED. THE SEABED CLASSES HAD A STATISTICALLY  SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH THE SEGMENTED BACKSCATTER CLASSES. IN  GENERAL HIGHER RHODOLITH COVERAGE CORRELATES WITH HIGHER BACKSCATTER.  THE BACKSCATTER MOSAIC OVER THE AREA IS MARKED BY AN EXTENSIVE PRESENCE  OF THE RED ALGAE PEYSSONELIAS RESULTING IN A LOWER CORRELATION INDEX  WHEN COMPARED TO THE AREAS WITH NO PEYSSONELIA.

THIS STUDY  ASSESSES THE MANAGEMENT OF 20 BRAZILIAN MERS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE  MANAGERS AND COMPRISES ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL  ASPECTS. OUR WORKING HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT MANAGERS CONSIDERED THAT MERS  PERFORMED POORLY AND THAT DIFFERENCES EXISTED BETWEEN THE RESULTS FOR  MERS AND LMES. IN GENERAL THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THAT THE  MANAGEMENT OF MPAS IS UNSATISFACTORY ESPECIALLY IN ECONOMIC TERMS. THE  ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECT OF MANAGEMENT OBTAINED THE MOST STRONGLY POSITIVE  ASSESSMENT. AMONG THE THREE LMES EVALUATED THE NORTH PLATFORM RESERVES  HAD THE WORST ASSESSMENT RESULTS. THE EAST COAST RESERVES AND THE SOUTH  PLATFORM RESERVES HAD EQUIVALENT RESULTS BUT THESE RESULTS WERE STILL  NOT ADEQUATE. MECHANISMS NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE  INCOME GENERATION FOR THE BENEFICIARIES. FURTHERMORE MOST OF THE AREAS  ASSESSED HAVE NO MANAGEMENT PLAN.

We used microcosm and field experiments to investigate and separate the effects of chemical vs. physical mechanisms potentially responsible for observed antagonistic in- teractions between the invasive corals and the endemic (southwest Atlantic) reef-building coral Mussismilia hispida. In the short term microcosm experiment M. hispida extruded a substantial amount of mesenterial filaments in an aggressive response to proximity to both invasive species within a few hours. However, in the field only the native coral suffered necrosis, which was visible after only four days. The use of physical barriers to separate chemical and physical effects demonstrated that antagonistic effects were far greater in the absence of a physical barrier than in the partial or complete barrier treatments, so although there is evidence that these invasive corals may produce allelochemicals against possible competitors we demonstrated that the main mechanism Tubastraea spp uses to exclude the native coral species is principally a rapid physical response.",,Antagonism between invasive pest corals Tubastraea spp. and the native reef-builder Mussismilia hispida in the southwest Atlantic,10.1016/j.jembe.2013.08.017,Santos,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,1,1

CENTRALITY MEASURES  ALLOW QUANTIFICATION OF HOW CENTRAL OR PERIPHERAL A SPECIES IS WITHIN A  NETWORK THUS INFORMING ABOUT THE ROLE OF EACH SPECIES IN NETWORK  ORGANIZATION DYNAMICS AND STABILITY. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE ADDRESSED  THE QUESTION WHETHER THE STRUCTURAL POSITION OF SPECIES IN THE NETWORK  I.E. THEIR TOPOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE RELATES TO THEIR ECOLOGICAL TRAITS.  WE STUDIED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CLEANER AND CLIENT REEF FISHES TO  IDENTIFY CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL SPECIES WITHIN A MUTUALISTIC NETWORK  AND INVESTIGATED FIVE ECOLOGICAL CORRELATES. WE USED THREE MEASURES TO  ESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF CENTRALITY OF A SPECIES FOR DISTINCT STRUCTURAL  PATTERNS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS AND THE STRUCTURAL  PROXIMITY TO OTHER SPECIES. THROUGH THE USE OF A PRINCIPAL COMPONENT  ANALYSIS PCA WE OBSERVED THAT THE CENTRALITY MEASURES WERE HIGHLY  CORRELATED 92.5\% IN THE STUDIED NETWORK WHICH INDICATES THAT THE  SAME SPECIES PLAYS A SIMILAR ROLE FOR THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURAL PATTERNS.  THREE CLEANER AND TEN CLIENT SPECIES HAD POSITIVE VALUES OF CENTRALITY  WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THESE SPECIES ARE MODULATING ECOLOGICAL AND  EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS WITHIN THE NETWORK. HIGHER CENTRALITIES WERE  RELATED TO HIGHER ABUNDANCES AND FEEDING HABITS FOR CLIENT FISHES BUT  NOT FOR CLEANERS. THE HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN CENTRALITY MEASURES IN  THE PRESENT STUDY IS LIKELY RELATED TO THE NESTED STRUCTURE OF THE  CLEANING NETWORK. THE CLEANER SPECIES' SET BY HAVING CENTRAL SPECIES  THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST ABUNDANT ONES BEARS POTENTIALLY MORE  VULNERABLE POINTS FOR NETWORK COHESIVENESS.

Most studies on reef systems have been conducted for true coral reefs, ecosystems that show calcareous formations with extensive coral cover and diversity. The aim of this study was to analyse the coverage of benthic assemblages in a submerged sandstone reef (22-24 m) in a relatively non-explored region (Tropical South-western Atlantic). In this area, filamentous algae (43.6%) and sponges (19.6%) are the main components of the benthic reef assemblages. Other benthic reef fauna (ascidians, corals and zoanthids) showed lower coverage, although their importance may vary depending on the area. A negative correlation between filamentous algae and slow-growing reef-building organisms (calcareous algae) was observed. High sand coverage (19.6%) over the reef revealed a high rate of silting. A low coral diversity (only two resilient species) was quantified, and most of the coral colonies were small-sized. The results provide a baseline assessment for a poorly known ecosystem with turbid-water benthic communities and higher sea-surface temperatures near the Earth's equator.",,The forgotten reefs: benthic assemblage coverage on a sandstone reef (Tropical South-western Atlantic),10.1017/s0025315416000965,Soares,Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom,1,1

Such debris is reported in every habitat of the oceans, from urban tourist beaches to remote islands and from the ocean surface to submarine canyons, and is found buried and deposited on sandy and cobble beaches. Plastic marine debris varies from micrometres to several metres in length and is potentially ingested by animals of every level of the marine food web. Here, we show that synthetic polymers are present in subsurface plankton samples around Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago in the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean. To explain the distribution of microplastics around the Archipelago, we proposed a generalised linear model (GLM) that suggests the existence of an outward gradient of mean plastic-particle densities. Plastic items can be autochthonous or transported over large oceanic distances.

Despite being considered as one of the most important mesophotic reef ecosystems of the South Atlantic, recent criticism on the existence of a living reef in the Amazon River mouth was raised by some scientists and politicians. the region is coveted for large-scale projects for oil and gas exploration. Here, we add to the increasing knowledge about the GARS by exploring evolutionary aspects of the reef using primary and secondary information on radiocarbon dating from carbonate samples. the results obtained demonstrate that the reef is alive and growing, with living organisms inhabiting the GARS in its totality.

The three sites presented significant differences on diversity, density and species dominance. CI presented the highest values, except for total density, which was higher at PV, probably due to its partial degree of protection. MI showed the lowest values, suggesting possible impacts from the proximity to the shore.

Two different processes may modulate fish antipredator behavior in the waters off remote archipelagos. First, places with low human density may have reduced fishing pressure. Second, due to their remoteness and lack of other human impacts, these isolated places may have more intact fish assemblages. We investigated antipredator behavior off the smallest archipelago in the Equatorial Atlantic not subjected to regular spearfishing by quantifying flight initiation distance (FID) - the distance a diver can approach a fish before it flees. Our goal was to identify natural patterns of risk assessment in reef fish. We focused on five common species and investigated how body size, group size and depth influence on the FID. In contrast to previous studies, we found that Caranx lugubris had significantly negative relationships between body size and FID, whereas Kyphosus sectatrix showed an opposite relationship. Finally, only a single species (Melichthys niger) had a significant relationship between depth and FID. Given we found small FID for all species studied, we suggest that much of our understanding of fish antipredator behavior studied using FID may reflect the somewhat ubiquitous impact of humans on species' risk assessments and not reflect patterns seen in areas with very low human density/disturbance. Our results suggest that fish antipredator behavior may be a metric of human impacts.",,Reef fish antipredator behavior in remote islands does not reflect patterns seen in coastal areas,10.1080/03949370.2019.1636141,FALSE,Ethology Ecology & Evolution,1,0.2

Lophelia is classified in the family Caryophylliidae and Madrepora in the family Oculinidae, both on the basis of skeletal morphology. Recent molecular studies of the scleractinians have given a new insight into the evolutionary history of this group. This study was aimed at clarifying the phylogenetic relationships of Lophelia and Madrepora, through the analysis of partial sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA. Sequences were obtained for samples of L. pertusa collected in the northeast Atlantic and off Brazil, M. oculata, four other deep-sea and eight tropical coral species from the R�union island in the Indian Ocean. The sequences were aligned with 69 homologous sequences of Scleractinia. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses support previously published molecular topologies. The two specimens of L. pertusa grouped with two caryophylliids, confirming the existing classification of the species, but the large genetic distance between the two Lophelia samples suggests that these populations are genetically isolated from one another. M. oculata did not cluster with oculinids, but formed a monotypic clade lying between the families Pocilloporidae and Caryophyliidae.

As a naturally occurring, available and ubiquitous substance most countries' legislations do not consider V/AA as harmful to the environment. We investigated the toxicity of household vinegar for the invasive corals Tubastraea coccinea and T. tagusensis (Dendrophylliidae), using injection (1, 2 or 4 of 10, 20 or 40 ml of vinegar) and immersion (full and half concentration; periods of 15, 30, 45, 60 or 120 min) treatments. For Tubastraea spp., immersion treatment always resulted in the death of the corals. In contrast, the lethality of injected vinegar depended on the number and volume of injections per coral colony; partially damaged colonies may be able to recover after vinegar injection. We also carried out a critical review and analysis regarding the use of V/AA in other aquatic species. V/AA has been tested and used as a biocide from virus and bacteria to fish; as for Tubastraea spp., three quarters of studies investigated the positive effects of V/AA as a biocide, the rest negative collateral effects on non-target species. We conclude that V/AA is an effective agent for killing Tubastraea spp. and most other aquatic organisms, can be applied using different methods and in different environments for controlling: (1) invasive or outbreak species; and (2) biofouling by native or invasive species on aquaculture systems and vectors.

Addressing these questions requires a comprehensive knowledge of the taxonomic composition of the marine fauna of the islands. A five-year survey in the shallow marine waters (up to 30 m) and a literature review on the data published for TMV have been conducted to document the biodiversity of the benthic fauna. Here we report on ten new records of decapod crustaceans from TMV: Gnathophyllum americanum and Thor amboinensis are circumtropical in distribution, whereas Stenopus hispidus, Gnathophylloides mineri and Parribacus antarcticus are disjunct circumtropical species as their distribution in the Atlantic Ocean is limited eastwardly to TMV or Ascension Island (S. hispidus), therefore, do not extending into the eastern Atlantic. Gnathophyllum circellum and Thor manningi are western Atlantic species, with G. circellum previously known only from the Caribbean Sea.

","Reefs, mangroves and seagrass biotopes often occur in close association, forming a complex and highly productive ecosystem that provide significant ecologic and economic goods and services. Different anthropogenic disturbances are increasingly affecting these tropical coastal habitats leading to growing conservation concern. In this field-based study, we used a visual census technique (belt transects 50 m x 2 m) to investigate the interactions between fishes and microhabitats at the Mamanguape Mangrove-Reef system, NE Brazil. Overall, 144 belt transects were performed from October 2007 to September 2008 to assess the structure of the fish assemblage. Fish trophic groups and life stage (juveniles and adults) were recorded according to literature, the percent cover of the substrate was estimated using the point contact method. Our results revealed that fish composition gradually changed from the Estuarine to the Reef zone, and that fish assemblage was strongly related to the microhabitat availability, as suggested by the predominance of carnivores at the Estuarine zone and presence of herbivores at the Reef zone. Fish abundance and diversity were higher in the Reef zone and estuary margins, highlighting the importance of structural complexity. A pattern of nursery area utilization, with larger specimens at the Transition and Reef Zone and smaller individuals at the Estuarine zone, was recorded for Abudefduf saxatilis, Anisotremus surinamensis, Lutjanus alexandrei, and Lutjanus jocu. Our findings clearly suggests ecosystem connectivity between mangrove, seagrass and reef biotopes, and highlighted the importance of Mamanguape Mangrove-Reef System as a priority area for conservation and research, whose habitat mosaics should be further studied and protected.",,"Fish assemblage of the Mamanguape Environmental Protection Area, NE Brazil: abundance, composition and microhabitat availability along the mangrove-reef gradient",10.1590/s1679-62252012000100011,Xavier,Neotropical Ichthyology,0.993827160493827,1

1492,SAA ACA 2020,2020,Unraveling interactions: do temperature and competition with native species affect the performance of the non-indigenous sun coral Tubastraea coccinea, Invasive species ? Metabolism ? Palythoa ? Species interactions ? Thermal plasticity ? Tubastraea,"The impact of invasive species has been increasing in recent decades due to globalization, threatening marine biodiversity. Tubastraea spp. (sun corals) have been spreading worldwide, showing rapid increases in abundance and/or spatial occupancy and adverse effects on recipient native ecosystems. In Brazil, they have become major invaders, extending discontinuously for more than 3000 km along the coast. Despite increased research efforts on sun coral ecology/biology over the last decade, information about the species' environmental tolerance and interactions with native species is still scarce. In this context, temperature may be an important driver, as it affects species interactions, primarily through its influence on organismal physiology. Thus, in the present study we assessed the effects of temperature in the invasive T. coccinea and the native zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum, as well as on their interactions, via a 3-week mesocosm experiment, exposing the species (individually and grafted together) to a temperature range of 16-31 �C. This was accompanied by measuring key physiological traits (metabolism, growth, feeding rates and competitive behavior) that underlie species performance, and hence, competitive strength. The results showed that at Arvoredo Island, Brazil, currently the southern distribution limit of both species, (1) T. coccinea exhibited limited capacity to adjust to sudden temperature changes, (2) T. coccinea's physical attacks did not affect P. caribaeorum, but induced increased metabolic costs in the former, while triggering increased growth in the latter, leading to eventual overgrowth of the sun coral and (3) that temperature interacted synergistically with the presence of the competitor in both species under high-temperature stress. These findings suggest that T. coccinea's successful invasion is mainly associated with r-selected life-history traits, rather than competitive strength or a high plasticity to temperature changes, and thus, communities with specific native competitors and/or a variable thermal regime may be more resistant to sun coral invasion.",,Unraveling interactions: do temperature and competition with native species affect the performance of the non-indigenous sun coral Tubastraea coccinea?,10.1007/s00338-019-01870-0,Almeida Saá,Coral Reefs,0.993377483443709,0.181818181818182

When changes in such conditions occur, their effects on distribution can be predicted through species distribution models, anticipating suitable habitats for the subsistence of species. Mussismilia harttii is one of the most endangered Brazilian endemic reef-building corals, and in increasing risk of extinction. Herein, species distribution models were used to determine the present and future potential habitats for M. harttii. Estimations were made through the maximum entropy approach, predicting suitable habitat losses and gains by the end of the 21st century. For this purpose, species records published in the last 20 years and current and future environmental variables were correlated. The best models were chosen according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and evaluated through the partial ROC (AUCratio), a new approach which uses independent occurrence data. Both approaches showed that the models performed satisfactorily in predicting potential habitat areas for the species. Future projections were made using the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for 2100, with different levels of greenhouse gas emission. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used to model the Future Potential Habitat (FPH) of M. harttii in two different scenarios: stabilization of emissions (RCP 4.5) and increase of emissions (RCP 8.5). According to the results, shallow waters to the south of the study area concentrate most of the current potential habitats for the species. However, in future scenarios, there was a loss of suitable areas in relation to the Current Potential Habitat (RCP 4.5 46% and RCP 8.5 59%), whereas there is a southward shift of the suitable areas. In all scenarios of FPH, the temperature was the variable with the greatest contribution to the models (> 35%), followed by the current velocity (> 33%) and bathymetry (>29%). In contrast, there is an increase of deep (50-75 m) suitable areas FPH scenarios, mainly in the southern portion of its distribution, at Abrolhos Bank (off Espirito Santo State). These deeper sites might serve as refugia for the species in global warming scenarios. Coral communities at such depths would be less susceptible to impacts of climate change on temperature and salinity However, the deep sea is not free from human impacts and measures to protect deeper ecosystems should be prioritized in environmental policies for Brazilian marine conservation, especially the Abrolhos Bank, due to its importance for M. harttii. mesophotic deep reef",,Modeling impacts of climate change on the potential habitat of an endangered Brazilian endemic coral: discussion about deep sea refugia,10.1101/517359,de Oliveira,,0.992647058823529,0.727272727272727

However, gonad histology remains the most robust way to identify sexual patterns in fishes. Some uncommon tissues remain poorly described, such as the accessory gonadal structures found in species from the Gobiidae family, which are rare in other bony fishes. This is the first report of the testicular gland in Gramma brasiliensis and for the Grammatidae family. Between April 2011 and February 2012 eighty specimens were collected during four dive campaigns on the Taipus de Fora reef (13�56'20""S 38�55'32""W), Bahia, Northeast Brazil, and their sex was determined. Thirteen per cent of the active-females and 90% of the active-males had testicular gland tissue in their ovotestis. This discovery led to additional research into the characteristics of the gland tissue and its relationship with gonadal maturation. Three patterns of testicular gland development were found in Brazilian basslet ovotestis. Both ova and sperm-producing gonad contained testicular gland tissue, and the appearance of this tissue seems to be the first modification of ovotestis tissue marking the beginning of the protogynous sex-change process in G. brasiliensis.",LEITE JR 2016 BRAZ J BIOL,Rediscovering hermaphroditism in Grammatidae with the description of the testicular gland in Brazilian Basslet Gramma brasiliensis,10.1590/1519-6984.03115,Leite,Brazilian Journal of Biology,0.99236641221374,1

There are quantitative and qualitative methods that estimate extinction probability based on past sighting records. However, because current baselines about species' abundances and distributions in the sea were mostly established after humans had started affecting marine populations, researchers must often rely on historical data to elucidate past environmental conditions. We review early historical records from the Archipelago of Saint Paul's Rocks, together with data from recent expeditions, with the aim of testing the hypothesis that reef sharks (Carcharhinus spp.) have become extinct there. Our analyses are based on non-parametric probabilistic tests for extinction and on a qualitative framework to examine and judge as objectively as possible the likelihood of local extinction. Until the mid-20th century, visitors to St. Paul's Rocks invariably commented on the remarkable number of sharks around the Archipelago. These observations contrast with those of expeditions carried out during the last decade, which report no carcharhinid reef sharks while scuba diving in the archipelago, despite many more hours of underwater fieldwork than previous expeditions. All quantitative and qualitative methods conclude that the reef shark Carcharhinus galapagensis is locally extinct at St. Paul's Rocks after a sharp decrease in abundance that took place following the commencement of fishing. However, the persistence of occasional individuals of the once locally common Carcharhinus falciformis in the vicinity of the Archipelago, as a result of constant immigration of this oceanic species from outside the area, suggest that the population might recover if the present fishing pressure was removed.",LUIZ OJ 2011 BIOL CONS,Extinction of a shark population in the Archipelago of Saint Paul’s Rocks (equatorial Atlantic) inferred from the historical record,10.1016/j.biocon.2011.08.004,Luiz,Biological Conservation,0.99236641221374,1

CONSUMER EFFECTS WERE NOT GENERAL  DEPENDING ON BOTH SITE AND SUCCESSIONAL STAGE. DURING EARLY SUCCESSION  AND AT SITES WHERE BARE SPACE WAS PROMPTLY OCCUPIED PREDATION DID NOT  REDUCE SPECIES RICHNESS PROBABLY BECAUSE SETTLEMENT OF A DIVERSE  SPECIES POOL WAS INTENSE.

The distributions of 1629 fish species were compiled for 31 locations across the A tlantic O cean (39�66' N , 27�50' S ). These locations provide a richness gradient ranging from 54 species in S t P aul's R ocks to 474 in C uba. We used cluster analyses to assess how historical and biogeographic factors have shaped the taxonomic and functional structure (i.e. the distribution of species within families, diet and body size groups) of assemblages. We then employed a constrained analysis of principal coordinates (CAP ) to test the relative influence of the distance from the biodiversity centre in the A tlantic, sea surface temperature, isolation, coral species richness and area, and coastal length on the observed patterns of assemblage structure. The taxonomic and functional structure of reef fish assemblages across the A tlantic exhibits a biogeographic fingerprint, with a marked discrimination between species-rich biogenic reefs (concentrated primarily in the C aribbean and composed of small species feeding on invertebrates) and poorer peripheral regions dominated by larger species with more diverse diets. The first CAP axis explains 87% of body size distribution in assemblages, showing that the effects of sea surface temperature and coral richness and those of isolation are antagonistic and can be embedded into a single dimension. Environmental factors, such as temperature and habitat complexity, explain the disproportionate number of small species in the C aribbean, whereas in the remaining regions the predominance of large-bodied fish increases with isolation due to high dispersal ability.",BENDER MG 2013 GLOB ECOL BIOGEOG,"Biogeographic, historical and environmental influences on the taxonomic and functional structure of Atlantic reef fish assemblages",10.1111/geb.12099,Bender,Global Ecology and Biogeography,0.992307692307692,1

Most southwestern Atlantic reefs are characterized by high sedimentation. However there are no temporal series of sediment deposition rates. We evaluated sediment deposition the sediment carbonate composition and coral and zoanthid covers on six reefs in Brazil over four-years. Sediment deposition rates varied from near zero to 233 mg cm-2�day-1 with peaks between August and December and yearly averages ranging from nine to 104 mg cm-2�day-1. Deposition rates presented site-specific correlations with wind indicating that resuspension must be a major factor. The presence of carbonates varied from 38% to 90% with two sites showing seasonal differences. Benthic communities were fairly similar among sites but the analyses suggested particular frequencies at each site. There was no significant correlation between sediment and benthic communities. However�Palythoa caribaeorum�usually occur in high sediment deposition areas. Our results did not corroborate previous data that suggested that a 10 mg cm-2�day-1would be a ""critical limit for coral survival"".

Additionally, we propose an easily calculated index that can be used to highlight areas with unique species composition for conservation planning. We estimated the strengths of associations between environmental factors and species richness and rarity. Ilha Grande Bay, Brazil, covering about 150,000 ha harbouring different marine habitats. We used the Marine Rapid Assessment Protocol at 42 sites to gather information on environmental variables and species in six subtidal marine groups. We determined ""singular"" sites as the regions harbouring higher numbers of rare species. Then, we estimated the roles of species loss and turnover on the observed total variation among sites. We used Generalized Linear Model to partition the relative importance of the selected environmental factors in driving variation in species richness and singularity. The singularity index and richness showed that the bay could be divided into three subregions for subtidal communities. Richness and rarity were structured at different spatial scales and associated with environmental variables related to water productivity and nutrients but varied among taxonomic groups. Community variation over space was largely associated with turnover of species. Higher singularity and richness on the western side of the bay and around the main island suggested that these regions should be conservation priorities, but high species turnover across the whole bay indicated that portions of the central channel should be included in conservation strategies. This draws attention to the importance of community variation rather than just species numbers in conservation and management planning. The high species turnover indicated that these rocky reefs have high beta diversity when compared to other studied biological systems.",CARLOS-JUNIOR LA 2019 DIVERS DISTRIB,Rarity and beta diversity assessment as tools for guiding conservation strategies in marine tropical subtidal communities,10.1111/ddi.12896,FALSE,Diversity and Distributions,0.991803278688525,0.230769230769231

Even being unique in the world, reefs from its mesophotic zone (i.e., >30 m depth) have never been described. For the first time, we surveyed the bottom features of Rocas Atoll mesophotic zone by using side scan sonar, a remotely operated vehicle and TRIMIX diving. Rhodolith beds were the main habitat observed, composed mainly by crustose coralline algae, and presenting different patterns of bed structure. In deeper areas (60-80 m), most rhodoliths were coalesced in patches of ?1 m2, while in the shallow areas (20- 50 m), the more typical pattern of free-living rhodoliths predominated. Depths between 50 and 65 m were marked as transitional zones in which a step-shaped carbonate reefs were discovered. In addition to describing the rhodolith beds and the formation of carbonate reefs by the coalescence of rhodoliths, we highlight the importance of oceanic areas such as the one investigated here. They are excellent models for testing and understanding the influence of rhodolith beds in supporting the marine biodiversity and in promoting demographic connectivity between shallow and mesophotic reefs",,Mesophotic ecosystems of the unique South Atlantic atoll are composed by rhodolith beds and scattered consolidated reefs,10.1007/s12526-015-0441-6,Amado-Filho,Marine Biodiversity,0.991735537190083,1

The present study aimed at defining the minimal time required to condition artificial substrates to enhance larval settlement of the coral Mussismilia braziliensis. Ceramic tiles were conditioned at the reef for different periods (0 [control], 6, 10, 20, and 30 weeks), and the fouling community was analyzed. The tiles were dominated by turf algae and crustose coralline algae (CCA) in all age treatments; plates 20 and 30 weeks old were statistically different than newer ones, having less turf algae and more CCA. When exposed to the different treatments, larvae of M. braziliensis recruited poorly on 6-week plates, and no spat were found on control plates. Our results highlight the importance of an adequate period of conditioning to optimize coral settlement. Although we are far from understanding the complex processes driving larval settlement, establishing baseline conditions for experiments is of foremost importance, even for conservation and management activities of coral reefs.",SEGAL B 2012 CEINC MAR,Experimental recruitment of the Brazilian endemic coral Mussismilia braziliensis and conditioning of settlement plates,10.7773/cm.v38i1a.1853,Segal,Ciencias Marinas,0.991596638655462,1

The structural complexity of algal habitats was measured and the associated malacofauna screened and identified. All three macroalgae differed significantly in the complexity of their habitat, with Sargassum polyceratium being the most complex. A total of 823 specimens of mollusks belonging to 22 species and 11 families were recorded, of which Columbellidae was the most represented with six species. The functional trait ""size"" revealed that micromollusks smaller than 10 millimeters were predominant in the community; however, individuals of larger sizes (up to 24.54 millimeters) belonging to young stages of other species were also present. Eight functional trophic groups were identified, of which ""carnivorous"" stood out with seven species. Six functional groups of microhabitats were identified, with intra-specific variation in habitats, while habitat expansion was documented for species not yet recorded in association with macroalgae. The structure of the molluskan community differed among the three algae species with the greatest richness, abundance, and diversity of mollusks and functional traits occurring with S. polyceratium . Community structure differed between algae adhered to natural substrate and detached algae, with the latter having lower mollusk richness and diversity, but with greater abundance of some species that remained on algal fronds after release from the reef environment.

THE MESOZOOPLANKTON WERE  SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ABUNDANT AT SUBSURFACE AND AT THE REEF EDGE COMPARED  TO CHANNEL ENVIRONMENTS. THE HIGH ABUNDANCE OF ORGANISMS AT REEF EDGES  SUGGESTS A LOW PREDATION PRESSURE ON ZOOPLANKTON AT NEAR-BOTTOM AREAS  SINCE THE REEFS OF TAMANDARE PRESENT A LOW COVERAGE OF PLANKTIVOROUS  CORALS BEING DOMINATED BY MACROALGAE. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT RATHER  THAN SINKS THESE ECOSYSTEMS MAY BE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT SOURCES OF  ZOOPLANKTON AVAILABLE FOR PLANKTIVOROUS SPECIES.

HOWEVER DURING THE PAST DECADES THE ESTUARY HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO BOTH  NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS SUCH AS A NATURAL OPENING OF AN INLET  AND CHANGES IN LAND USE. THIS STUDY IS BASED ON THREE DATED CORES TAKEN  FROM THE INLET TO THE MAIN CHANNEL. A SHIFT IN THE ORGANIC AND INORGANIC  PROXIES IN THE EARLY 1960S SHOWS THE IMPACT OF THIS NATURAL OPENING ON  THE HYDRODYNAMICS AND SEDIMENT DISTRIBUTION.

A BONGO  NET MESH SIZES OF 64 120 AND 300 MU M WAS USED FOR SAMPLE  COLLECTIONS. A TOTAL OF 462 ZOOPLANKTON SAMPLES WAS STUDIED. THESE  SAMPLES WERE CLASSIFIED IN FOUR AREAS COASTAL INNER SHELF SHELF  BREAK SLOPE ACCORDING TO LOCAL DEPTH AND DISTANCE FROM COAST. MOST OF  THE STUDIED ENVIRONMENT IS OLIGOTROPHIC UNDER THE TROPICAL WATER MASS  INFLUENCE. WE RECORDED 199 ZOOPLANKTON TAXA AND COPEPODA WAS THE MOST  NUMEROUS WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF SPECIES. THERE WERE 93 SPECIES OF  COPEPODS OF WHICH CALANOIDS COMPRISED 62\%. THE MOST FREQUENT  ZOOPLANKTON TAXA WERE UNDINULA VULGARIS NANNOCALANUS MINOR OITHONA  NANA ONYCHOCORYCAEUS GIESBRECHTI CRUSTACEA NAUPLIUS BIVALVIA AND  GASTROPODA VELIGERS.

THE BIOMASS DECREASED SHARPLY BETWEEN THE MICROZOOPLANKTON TO  MACROZOOPLANKTON FRACTIONS. THE COMMUNITY PRESENTED A GENERAL TREND IN  SPECIES COMPOSITION THAT INCLUDED COASTAL EUTROPHIC INDICATORS AND  OCEANIC OLIGOTROPHIC INDICATORS WITH LOW NUMERICAL ABUNDANCE OF  ZOOPLANKTONIC ORGANISMS. A HIGHER DENSITY OCCURS IN THE COASTAL AREA  THAT IS NEAR THE LITTORAL AREA DUE TO THE CONTINENTAL FLUX AND BENTHIC  REGENERATION. THE SEASONAL EFFECT WAS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED AS AN IMPORTANT  FACTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISSIMILARITY OF ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES.

The coral holobiont consists of the coral animal and a variety of associated microorganisms that include symbiotic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses. The interactions among these components are crucial for coral health and, consequently, to the coral reef resilience to disturbance. Environmental stressors such as elevated temperature, high irradiance and ultraviolet (UV) radiation can lead to the breakdown of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis in a phenomenon known as ""coral bleaching"". The present study provides evidence for virus-like particles (VLPs) induced in UV-irradiated Symbiodinium spp. cultures (clades A and C) that were isolated from the coral Mussismilia braziliensis, suggesting a latent viral infection in these strains. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images of the UV stressed cultures revealed the presence of giant (ca. 450 nm) and small (ca. 40 nm) VLPs.

HOWEVER THE MOST ASSESSMENTS OF MPA MANAGEMENT  EFFECTIVENESS IS UNDERTAKEN SOLELY BASED ON MANAGERS' PERCEPTIONS. HERE  WE COMPARED THE PERCEPTIONS OF MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS AMONG MANAGERS  AND THE MANAGEMENT COUNCIL MEMBERS OF THREE BRAZILIAN MARINE RESERVES.  COUNCIL MEMBERS INCLUDE STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS  WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. OVERALL THE MARINE RESERVES WERE CLASSIFIED  AS HAVING MEDIUM MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS WITH MANAGERS PERCEIVING  HIGHER LEVELS OF EFFECTIVENESS THAN THE COUNCIL MEMBERS. THE MAIN  DIFFERENCES WERE RELATED TO POOR COMMUNICATION AMONG MANAGERS AND  COUNCIL MEMBERS AND THE PERCEPTION OF LACK OF PARTICIPATION ON  MANAGEMENT DECISIONS BY COUNCIL MEMBERS. ASSESSING DIFFERENT  PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS GIVES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE  UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MANAGERS AND  STAKEHOLDERS IS ESSENTIAL TO GUARANTEE THAT MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES ARE  MORE EQUALLY RECOGNIZED. WE RECOMMEND THAT FURTHER EVALUATIONS CONSIDER  THE DIVERSITY OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THE MANAGEMENT TO GET A MORE  REALISTIC ASSESSMENT ON MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS.

TO INVESTIGATE THE  MORPHOLOGY OF THE INCISED VALLEY AND THE SURROUNDING SHELF AREA WE  ANALYZED LANDSAT IMAGES AND BATHYMETRIC SHALLOW SEISMIC AND  SEDIMENTOLOGICAL DATA. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE AIV IS A  COASTAL-PLAIN INCISED VALLEY.

1482,ROSA IC 2011 BIOD CONS,2011,"Fisheries and trade of seahorses in Brazil: historical perspective, current trends, and future directions ",Brazil ? CITES ? National controls ? Seahorse fishery and trade ? Conservation,"Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are globally threatened by overexploitation and habitat destruction; they are also regarded as susceptible to heavy exploitation due to some of their life-history traits. From an economic perspective, they are fishes with high monetary value and marketability. Seahorses are now listed in Appendix II of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), to ensure that the international trade is not detrimental to the survival of wild populations; the effectiveness evaluation of these international controls needs comparable monitoring data, including evaluation of spatial and temporal trends. This study assesses the seahorse trade in Brazil, aiming to detect trends in catch levels, volumes and prices. Our main findings were: the dried trade was unregulated, without formal records, and primarily domestic, although records of unreported exports existed; it was primarily sustained by incidental captures in trawl nets. The live seahorse trade was mainly destined for exports, and regulated through national quotas. Between 2002 and 2009, mean prices for dried seahorses ranged from US$1.06 � 0.46 (level 1 traders) to US$2.78 � 0.68 (end-sellers) each, while mean prices for each live seahorse traded on the domestic market (1997-2009) ranged from US$1.13 � 0.02 (level 1 traders) to US$10.08 � 1.71 (retailers). Mean declared export price (2006-2008) was 15.57 � 10.87. Enhanced implementation of the CITES listing in Brazil will require further research, and additional measures to address both direct and indirect fishing pressure on seahorse populations.",,"Fisheries and trade of seahorses in Brazil: historical perspective, current trends, and future directions",10.1007/s10531-011-0068-2,Rosa,Biodiversity and Conservation,0.990566037735849,1

PREDATION WAS VERY IMPORTANT IN  DETERMINING TAXA IDENTITY AND DOMINANCE REDUCING SPATIAL MONOPOLIZATION  BY ASCIDIANS AND INCREASING THE AREA OCCUPIED BY BRYOZOANS BUT OVERALL  PREDATION DID NOT RESULT IN A MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITY. THE LOCALIZED  EXTINCTION OF ASCIDIANS IN PREDATION TREATMENTS WAS COMPENSATED BY AN  INCREASE IN THE DIVERSITY OF BRYOZOANS AND BARNACLES. INTERESTINGLY  PREDATION DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HAD ONLY  SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON THE TAXA RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION. AFTER 5 MONTHS  PREDATOR EXCLUSION DURING THE EARLY LIFE-HISTORY STAGES HAD NO EFFECT ON  COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND ONLY CURRENT LEVELS OF PREDATION DETERMINED  DIFFERENCES IN COMPOSITION. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT PREDATION CAN CAUSE  CHANGES IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY WITHOUT  NECESSARY CHANGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CO-OCCURRING TAXA.

THEREFORE THIS STUDY AIMED TO COMPARE THE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE OF  FISH ASSEMBLAGES FOUND IN VEGETATED AND UNVEGETATED AREAS IN A TROPICAL  ESTUARY. SAMPLES WERE TAKEN IN TWO AREAS WITH SEAGRASS HALODULE  WRIGHTII AND TWO WHERE THIS VEGETATION IS ABSENT TIDAL FLATS  OBSERVING VARIATIONS IN THE HYDROLOGICAL REGIME BETWEEN THE DRY AND  RAINY SEASONS OF 2014. A TOTAL OF 86 SPECIES WERE RECORDED OF WHICH 11  OCCURRED ONLY IN VEGETATED AREAS AND 31 ONLY IN THE UNVEGETATED REGIONS.

An understudied behavioural tactic is the follower-feeding association, in which individuals of a species follow (called ""follower"") and benefit from the foraging activities of individuals of another species that disturbs the substrate (called ""nuclear""). Here, we investigated the incidence of this tactic at three oceanic islands in the southwestern Atlantic by characterizing pairwise, and the emergent network of follower-feeding associations. We quantified associations among species according to their trophic categories, activity period, and group size. The incidence of follower-feeding associations was higher at islands with higher species richness, but the proportion of associations per species was higher at islands with lower species richness. Overall, mobile invertebrate-feeders, omnivores and macrocarnivores were the most common trophic categories engaged in this tactic. Most of follower-feeding associations involved diurnal species, which indicates that followers rely on visual cues to engage in this tactic. We also found that nuclear species were mainly solitary, while followers tended to aggregate in small- to medium-sized groups. Our study indicates that follower-feeding association is an opportunistic yet frequent feeding tactic at oceanic islands, which may stem from resource partitioning in such remote habitats.",INAGAKI KY 2020 ENVIRON BIOL FISHES,The structure of fish follower-feeding associations at three oceanic islands in southwestern Atlantic,10.1007/s10641-019-00924-0,FALSE,Environmental Biology of Fishes,0.990196078431373,0.142857142857143

ONE WAY OF ADDRESSING HOW ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE  MAY AFFECT THE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION OF CORALLINE ALGAL MATS IS TO EXAMINE  THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF INVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS  HABITAT AND HOW THEY CORRELATE TO KEY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HERE WE  INVESTIGATED THE DYNAMICS OF AMPHIPOD ASSEMBLAGES INHABITING CORALLINE  ALGAL MATS AT TWO SITES IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL FROM SEPTEMBER 2010 TO  AUGUST 2013. TWENTY-TWO DIFFERENT SPECIES WERE RECORDED ENCOMPASSING  TWO LIFESTYLES FREE-LIVING AND TUBE-DWELLING AND FOUR FEEDING HABITS  DETRITIVOROUS OMNIVOROUS HERBIVOROUS AND CARNIVOROUS. CONSISTENTLY  ACROSS SITES AND OVER THE YEARS SPECIES DIVERSITY PEAKED IN AUTUMN  TOGETHER WITH THE PASSING OF COLD FRONTS AND INCREASED WAVE HEIGHT.  PHYSICAL DISTURBANCE THROUGH WAVE ACTION CAUSED ALGAL MAT THINNING AND  REDUCED OVERALL AMPHIPOD ABUNDANCE SUGGESTING HABITAT LIMITATION BUT  ALSO DECREASED SPECIES DOMINANCE ALLOWING OTHER SPECIES TO BUILD UP  POPULATIONS OVER AUTUMN AND WINTER.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASING CO2 PARTIAL PRESSURE  IN THE ATMOSPHERE CAN POTENTIALLY INDUCE OXIDATIVE STRESS WITH  CONSEQUENT CELLULAR DAMAGE IN CORALS AND HYDROCORALS. IN THE PRESENT  STUDY PARAMETERS RELATED TO OXIDATIVE STATUS WERE EVALUATED IN THE  HYDROCORAL MILLEPORA ALCICORNIS EXPOSED TO THREE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF  SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION USING A MESOCOSM SYSTEM. CO2-DRIVEN ACIDIFICATION  OF SEAWATER WAS PERFORMED UNTIL REACHING 0.3 0.6 AND 0.9 PH UNITS BELOW  THE CURRENT PH OF SEAWATER PUMPED FROM THE CORAL REEF ADJACENT TO THE  MESOCOSM.

THEREFORE REEFS WITHIN A VALLEY AND ON ITS ADJACENCIES ARE LIKELY TO  EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS DESPITE THE GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY. AN  EXTENSIVE BIOGENIC REEF FORMATION AT THE BRAZILIAN EQUATORIAL SHELF  OCCURRING WITHIN AND AROUND A VALLEY WAS RECENTLY DESCRIBED FROM THE  GEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. GIVEN THE RELATIVE PAUCITY OF BIOGENIC REEFS  ALONG THE BRAZILIAN COAST UNDERSTANDING THESE BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES IS  CRITICAL. WE ASSESSED BENTHIC AND FISH COMMUNITIES IN THESE REEFS USING  PHOTOQUADRATS AND VISUAL CENSUS RESPECTIVELY. WE STUDIED REEFS WITHIN  THE VALLEY ON THE WEST AND EAST OF THE DEPRESSION TO EVALUATE IF THE  STRONGER TIDAL CURRENTS WITHIN THE VALLEY AND ITS CONNECTION TO A  SUBMARINE CANYON WOULD DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECT BENTHIC AND FISH  COMMUNITIES AMONG THESE AREAS. WE FOUND HIGHER CORAL COVER AND LOWER  MACROALGAL COVER ON REEFS LOCATED WITHIN THE VALLEY. FISH BIOMASS WAS  SIMILAR AMONG AREAS BUT BIOMASS DISTRIBUTION AMONG FUNCTIONAL GROUPS  WAS VARIABLE. INVERTIVORES AND PISCIVORES BIOMASS WAS GREATER ON REEFS  WITHIN THE VALLEY POTENTIALLY RESULTING FROM HIGHER FOOD AVAILABILITY  AND NUTRIENT INPUT.

SUCH DIFFERENCES IN TIME-AVERAGING MAGNITUDE CONFIRM THE  ASSUMPTION THAT TAPHONOMIC PROCESSES ARE SUBJECT TO STOCHASTIC VARIATION  AT ALL SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. DESPITE THESE DIFFERENCES EACH  SAMPLE IS TEMPORALLY INCOMPLETE AT CENTENNIAL RESOLUTION AND THREE OF  THE FOUR SAMPLES HAVE SIMILAR RIGHT-SKEWED AGE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS.  SIMULATIONS OF TEMPORAL COMPLETENESS INDICATE THAT SAMPLES OF BOTH  SPECIES FROM THE SHALLOW SITE ARE CONSISTENT WITH A MORE STRONGLY  RIGHT-SKEWED AND LESS-COMPLETE AGE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION THAN THOSE  FROM THE DEEP SITE.  WE CONCLUDE THAT INTRINSIC CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH SPECIES EXERT LESS  CONTROL ON THE TIME-AVERAGING SIGNATURE OF THESE SAMPLES THAN DO  EXTRINSIC FACTORS SUCH AS VARIATION IN RATES OF SEDIMENTATION AND  TAPHONOMIC DESTRUCTION.

TOURISM IS PRESENTLY INCREASING ITS  IMPACT ON RHODOLITH BEDS. GLOBAL WARMING AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ARE  ALSO DETERMINANT FACTORS IN FAUNAL CHANGE. OBJECTIVE TO ANALYSE THE  POLYCHAETE ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH RHODOLITH BEDS SUBJECT TO  DIFFERENT INTENSITIES OF TOURISTIC PRESSURE AT SEIXAS BEACH NE BRAZIL  WHERE TOURISM IS GRADUALLY INCREASING OVER TIME. METHODS EFFECTS WERE  EVALUATED AT TWO DEPTHS 1.5 M AND 4.0 M. SAMPLING WAS DONE EVERY TWO  MONTHS DURING 2015 ENCOMPASSING THE TWO MARKED SEASONS OF THE YEAR IN  THE REGION RAINY AND DRY. QUADRATS OF 15 X 15 CM WERE PLACED IN EACH  DEPTH DURING SAMPLING. ALL RHODOLITHS PRESENT WITHIN THE QUADRAT WERE  COLLECTED USUALLY FOUR TO FIVE RHODOLITHS. OUR HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT THE  DEEPER DEPTH AND THE SAMPLES FROM THE DRY SEASON MONTHS WOULD BE  INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO THE IMPACT OF TOURISM. RESULTS OVERALL 49  SPECIES WERE FOUND FROM 21 DIFFERENT FAMILIES AND A TOTAL OF 733  INDIVIDUALS WERE COLLECTED.

Even though bacteria have previously been described in early life stages of corals, these early life stages (larvae) could have been inoculated in the water and not inside the parental colony (through gametes) carrying the parental microbiome. How Symbiodinium is transmitted to offspring is also not clear, as only one study has described this mechanism in spawners. All other studies refer to incubators. To explore the VT hypothesis and the key components being transferred, colonies of the broadcast spawner species Mussismilia hispida were kept in nurseries until spawning. Gamete bundles, larvae and adult corals were analyzed to identify their associated microbiota with respect to composition and location. Symbiodinium and bacteria were detected by sequencing in gametes and coral planula larvae. However, no cells were detected using microscopy at the gamete stage, which could be related to the absence of those cells inside the oocytes/dispersed in the mucus or to a low resolution of our approach. A preliminary survey of Symbiodinium diversity indicated that parental colonies harbored Symbiodinium clades B, C and G, whereas only clade B was found in oocytes and planula larvae [5 days after fertilization (a.f.)]. The core bacterial populations found in the bundles, planula larvae and parental colonies were identified as members of the genera Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia, Inquilinus and Bacillus, suggesting that these populations could be vertically transferred through the mucus. The collective data suggest that spawner corals, such as M. hispida, can transmit Symbiodinium cells and the bacterial core to their offspring by a coral gamete (and that this gamete, with its bacterial load, is released into the water), supporting the HTE. However, more data are required to indicate the stability of the transmitted populations to indicate whether the holobiont can be considered a unit of natural selection or a symbiotic assemblage of independently evolving organisms.",LEITE DCA 2017 FRONT MICROBIOL,Broadcast Spawning Coral Mussismilia hispida Can Vertically Transfer its Associated Bacterial Core,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00176,Leite,Frontiers in Microbiology,0.98989898989899,1

WE USED UNDERWATER VISUAL CENSUSES  TO QUANTIFY FISH ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY FROM THE SHALLOW INTERTIDAL TO  THE SUBTIDAL ZONE DURING BOTH FLOOD AND EBB TIDES IN SEAGRASS BEDS  SURROUNDING THE DONGSHA ISLAND SOUTH CHINA SEA. WE ALSO RECORDED FISH  FEEDING HABITS BY ANALYZING STOMACH CONTENTS.  RESULTS AT LEAST 70 FISH SPECIES WERE OBSERVED IN THE SEAGRASS BEDS  DURING THE STUDY PERIODS. FISH DENSITY AND DIVERSITY INCREASED WITH  INCREASING DEPTHS AS WELL AS DURING FLOOD TIDES. THE INTERTIDAL AREAS  WERE CHARACTERIZED BY MORE VARIATION IN BOTH FISH ASSEMBLAGE AND TROPHIC  STRUCTURE THAN THE SUBTIDAL AREAS. A CLUSTER ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED SIX  PRINCIPAL FEEDING GROUPS AND INVERTEBRATE-FEEDING CARNIVORES CONTRIBUTED  ABOUT 70\% OF THE TOTAL FISH ABUNDANCE. THE DENSITY OF HERBIVORES  LARGE-SIZED CARNIVORES AND PISCIVORES BUT NOT SMALL-SIZED CARNIVORES  INCREASED DURING FLOOD TIDES. IN CONTRAST DETRITIVORES DECREASED IN  DENSITY DURING FLOOD TIDES. A HEATMAP OF HABITAT USAGE PATTERN REVEALED  THAT MOST FISH SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR DEEPER STATIONS AND FLOOD TIDES.

AS EXPECTED THE  MEAN ALPHA DIVERSITY OF RARE SPECIES D-0 DOUBLED FROM CONTROL TO HIGH  COMPLEXITY AREAS AND DECREASED BY HALF FROM DAY TO NIGHT. THE DIVERSITY  OF TYPICAL SPECIES CD ALSO DOUBLED FROM CONTROL TO HIGH COMPLEXITY  AREAS BUT DID NOT REDUCE AT NIGHT. COMPLEXITY AND DIEL PERIOD DID NOT  HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DIVERSITY OF DOMINANT SPECIES D-2. NO  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPLEXITY AND ALPHA DIVERSITY WAS WEAKENED AT  NIGHT. BETA DIVERSITY OF THE THREE DIVERSITY ORDERS SIGNIFICANTLY  DIFFERED FROM 1 TOTALLY HOMOGENEOUS VESSEL REEF INDICATING THAT  COMPLEXITY UNDERLIES PATTERNS OF BETA DIVERSITY.

ONLAP DOWNLAP TRUNCATION  LITHOFACIES BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND PALEO-WATER DEPTHS. BY USING THESE  OBSERVATIONS COUPLED TO A KINEMATIC AND FLEXURAL MODEL FOR THE  DEFORMATION OF THE LITHOSPHERE WE HAVE ELUCIDATED THE TECTONIC  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRESERVED STRATIGRAPHY THAT COMPRISES THE  GABON-CABINDA MARGIN OF WEST AFRICA. TWO HINGE ZONES AN EASTERN AND  ATLANTIC FORMED ALONG THE GABAN-CABINDA MARGIN IN RESPONSE TO THREE  DISCRETE EXTENSIONAL EVENTS OCCURRING FROM BERRIASIAN TO APTIAN TIME.  THE EASTERN HINGE ZONE DEMARCATES THE EASTERN LIMIT OF A BROADLY  DISTRIBUTED BERRIASIAN EXTENSION THAT RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF DEEP  ANOXIC LACUSTRINE SYSTEMS AS EVIDENCED BY THE SILTS AND SHALES OF THE  SIALIVAKOU AND LOWER DJENO FORMATIONS AND THE REGRESSIVE PACKAGES OF THE  UPPER DJENO FORMATION. APPROXIMATELY 1.5 TO 2 KM OF ASYMMETRIC FOOTWALL  UPLIFT WAS INDUCED ACROSS THE EASTERN HINGE ZONE IN RESPONSE TO THE  MECHANICAL UNLOADING OF THE LITHOSPHERE DURING THIS FIRST PHASE OF  RIFTING. IN CONTRAST THE ATLANTIC HINGE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 90 KM  WEST OF THE EASTERN HINGE MARKS THE EASTERN LIMIT OF A SECOND PHASE OF  EXTENSION THAT BEGAN IN THE HAUTERIVIAN. FOOTWALL UPLIFT AND ROTATION  EXPOSED EARLIER SYN-RIFT AND PRE-RIFT SEDIMENTS TO AT LEAST WAVEBASE  CAUSING VARYING AMOUNTS OF EROSIONAL TRUNCATION ACROSS THE ATLANTIC  HINGE ZONE ALONG MUCH OF THE GABON-CABINDA MARGINS. WE INTERPRET THE  THICKNESS VARIATIONS OF REWORKED ELASTIC SEDIMENT OF THIS AGE E.G. THE  MELANIA FORMATION BETWEEN THE HINGE ZONES AS INDICATIVE OF VARIATIONS  IN THE DEGREE OF UPLIFT AND EROSIONAL TRUNCATION OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE.  FOR EXAMPLE THE ABSENCE OF MELANIA FORMATION ACROSS THE CONGO MARGIN  IMPLIES THAT UPLIFT OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE WAS RELATIVELY MINOR COMPARED  TO THAT ACROSS THE CABINDA AND GABON MARGINS THE LATTER BEING  CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT THICKNESSES OF MELANIA FORMATION OR  EQUIVALENT. MATERIAL ERODED FROM THE CABINDA AND GABON ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONE MAY IN PART ACCOUNT FOR THE THICK WEDGE OF SEDIMENT DEPOSITED  SEAWARD OF THE GABON-CABINDA ATLANTIC HINGE THE ERVA FORMATION. OUR  MODELLING SUGGESTS THAT THIS WEDGE OF REWORKED ELASTICS REPRESENTS  DEPOSITION BY ALONG-AXIS GRAVITY FLOWS WITHIN A DEEP WATER APPROXIMATE  TO 2 KM ENVIRONMENT. A THIRD AND FINAL PHASE OF EXTENSION IN THE LATE  BARREMIAN-EARLY APTIAN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BREACHING THE CONTINENTAL  LITHOSPHERE TO FARM THE OCEAN/CONTINENT BOUNDARY AND THUS THE  INSTALLATION OF OPEN MARINE CONDITIONS. ELSEWHERE THE ENVIRONMENTS WILL  TEND TO BE MARGINAL MARINE TO BRACKISH DEPENDING ON THE EFFICIENCY OF  THE ATLANTIC HINGE ZONE TO ACT AS A BARRIER TO MARINE ENCHROACHMENT.  THIS THIRD RIFT PHASE REACTIVATED BOTH THE EASTERN AND ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONES THEREBY CREATING ACCOMMODATION FOR THE MARNES NOIRES FORMATION  AND EQUIVALENT SOURCE ROCK DEPOSITION BETWEEN THE HINGES AND THE  FALCAO SOURCE ROCK EQUIVALENT SEAWARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE. TWO  POSSIBLE SCENARIOS EXIST FOR THE LATERAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE MARNES  NOIRES FORMATION IF THE REACTIVATED RIFT FLANK TOPOGRAPHY ACROSS THE  ATLANTIC HINGE WAS SIGNIFICANT THEN SEDIMENTATION WOULD BE RESTRICTED  BETWEEN THE HINGE ZONES WITHIN DISCRETE LACUSTRINE SETTINGS E.G. CONGO  MARGIN ALTERNATIVELY IF HINGE ZONE UPLIFT WAS RELATIVELY MINOR THEN  A CORAL-RIMMED ARCHIPELAGO MAY HAVE DEVELOPED PARALLEL TO THE MARGIN  WITH RESTRICTED COMMUNICATION ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HINGE ZONE E.G.   CABINDA MARGIN IN THIS LATTER SCENARIO DILUTION OF THE MARNES  NOIRES SOURCE ROCKS BY TERRIGENOUS INPUT FROM THE ERODING ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONE SHOULD BE RELATIVELY MINOR THEREBY ENHANCING SOURCE ROCK QUALITY  FURTHERMORE POTENTIAL MARINE UPWELLING OUTBOARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE  ZONE IS LIKELY THE CAUSE FOR THE PRODUCTION AND ACCUMULATION OF  ORGANIC-RICH MATERIAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE FALCAO SOURCE ROCK OF THE  KWANZA BASIN. BY LATE APTIAN TIME THE REMAINING ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN  THE HINGE ZONES WAS PARTIALLY FILLED BY ACROSS-AND ALONG-AXIS PROGRADING  DELTAIC SYSTEMS OF THE ARGILLES VERTES AND TCHIBOTA FORMATIONS. THE  PROGRADATION AND INTERACTION OF THE ARGILLES VERTES DEPOSITIONAL LOBES  RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF RESIDUAL PALEO-RELIEF. SUBSEQUENT MARINE  INCURSIONS AND FLOODING OF THIS PALEO-RELIEF LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF  BASAL CONGLOMERATES THE CHELA `LAG' UNCONFORMITY GRADING UPWARD INTO  FINE-GRAINED SANDS AND EVAPORITES CONSEQUENTLY AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP  SHOULD EXIST BETWEEN EVAPORITE THICKNESS IN PARTICULAR THE LOWER  MEMBERS AND THE THICKNESS OF THE UNDERLYING ARGILLES VERTES AND  TCHIBOTA FORMATIONS. VARIATIONS IN LOEME EVAPORITE THICKNESS IS A  CONSEQUENCE OF STRATIGRAPHIC AND STRUCTURAL CONTROL WITH SALT  INSTABILITY INFLUENCING LOCAL VARIABILITY  OUR MODELING SUGGESTS THE OCCURRENCE OF TWO DISTINCT EVAPORITE SEQUENCES  ON THE CONGO MARGIN AN EARLIER EVAPORITE DEPOSITED SEAWARD WEST OF  THE ATLANTIC HINGE DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD RIFT PHASES AND THE LATE  APTIAN LOEME FORMATION DEPOSITED BETWEEN THE HINGE ZONES. AN EVAPORITE  SEQUENCE SEAWARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE IS INFERRED ON THE BASIS OF  EXTENSIVE DIAPIRS AND SALT TECTONIC STRUCTURES OBSERVED IN SEISMIC DATA.  IN ORDER TO MATCH THE DISTRIBUTION AND THICKNESS OF THE OBSERVED  POST-SALT STRATIGRAPHY ACROSS THE BASIN HOWEVER WE REQUIRE LARGE  PALEOWATER DEPTHS WEST OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE DURING THE LATER APTIAN  THE EXISTENCE OF LARGE PALEOWATER DEPTHS PRECLUDES THE FORMATION OF  THICK EVAPORITE SEQUENCES WITHIN THE OUTER BASIN CONSEQUENTLY WE  PROPOSE THAT THE EVAPORITES SEAWARD OF THE ATLANTIC HINGE WERE FORMED  DURING THE SYN-RIFT DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARGIN AND ARE NOT  CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THE POST-RIFT LOEME SALTS DEPOSITED BETWEEN THE  HINGE ZONES.

WE SAMPLED 19 BRAZILIAN REEFS DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN 3 AND  61 M DEPTH AND TESTED FIVE DRRH PREDICTIONS REGARDING SPECIES DIVERSITY  DISTRIBUTION AND FUNCTIONAL PROFILE OF COMMUNITIES. THE FIRST  PREDICTION WAS THAT DEEP REEFS >30 M DEPTH SHOULD HOST GREATER GAMMA  DIVERSITY TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT SPECIES TO SHALLOW REEFS <30 M. SECOND  DEPTH-GENERALIST SPECIES SHOULD DOMINATE THE SHALLOW REEFS OTHERWISE  LOCAL EXTIRPATION IN SHALLOW AREAS COULD NOT BE REVERTED BY THE DEEP  REEFS. THIRD ALPHA DIVERSITY SHOULD BE GREATER IN DEEP REEFS DUE TO  REDUCED ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURE IN DEEPER AREAS. FOURTH BETA DIVERSITY  SHOULD BE SMALLER AMONG SHALLOW THAN DEEP REEFS DUE TO THE HUMAN-INDUCED  SPREAD OF A FEW DISTURBANCE-ADAPTED SPECIES NEAR SEA SURFACE. FINALLY  THE FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF SHALLOW REEFS SHOULD BE A SUBSET FROM THAT  OF DEEP REEFS TO ALLOW FUNCTIONAL RECOVERING OF SHALLOWER AREAS.  CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS CORAL COMMUNITIES PRESENTED TWICE MORE GAMMA  DIVERSITY IN SHALLOW THAN DEEP REEFS 13 VS. SEVEN EFFECTIVE SPECIES  AND ONLY THREE OUT OF 17 SPECIES OCCURRED ALONG THE ENTIRE GRADIENT.  ADDITIONALLY THE ALPHA DIVERSITY OF RARE TYPICAL AND DOMINANT SPECIES  WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN SHALLOW AND DEEP REEFS AND THE BETA DIVERSITY OF  RARE AND TYPICAL SPECIES WAS ABOUT 50\% GREATER IN SHALLOW THAN DEEP  REEFS.

HOWEVER SOFT CORALS WERE OBSERVED ONLY IN  SHALLOW REEFS AND AZOOXANTHELLATED CORALS WERE RECORDED ONLY IN DEEP  REEFS.

THE LATTER BECAME MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT DURING  THE PAST FEW THOUSAND YEARS AND PARTICULARLY DURING THE `ANTHROPOCENE'.  HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT IN THIS RESPECT AS YET  MUCH LESS IS KNOWN FROM TROPICAL THAN FROM HIGH LATITUDE COASTS.  TROPICAL COASTS RECEIVE THE MAJORITY OF RIVER INPUTS INTO THE OCEAN  THEY HARBOR A VARIETY OF DIVERSE ECOSYSTEMS AND A MAJORITY OF THE  POPULATION LIVES THERE AND ECONOMICALLY DEPENDS ON THEIR NATURAL  RESOURCES. THIS REVIEW DELINEATES THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL RESPONSE OF COASTAL  SYSTEMS TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND THE INTERPLAY OF NATURAL AND  ANTHROPOGENIC CONTROL FACTORS NOWADAYS AND IN THE RECENT GEOLOGICAL PAST  WITH AN EMPHASIS ON TROPICAL REGIONS. WEATHERING RATES ARE HIGHER IN LOW  THAN IN HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS WITH A MAXIMUM IN THE SE ASIA/WESTERN  PACIFIC REGION. ON A GLOBAL SCALE THE NET EFFECT OF INCREASING EROSION  DUE TO DEFORESTATION AND SEDIMENT RETENTION BEHIND DAMS IS A REDUCED  SEDIMENT INPUT INTO THE OCEANS DURING THE ANTHROPOCENE. HOWEVER AN  INCREASE WAS OBSERVED IN THE SE ASIA/WESTERN PACIFIC REGION. NITROGEN  AND PHOSPHORUS INPUTS INTO THE OCEAN HAVE TREBLED BETWEEN THE 1970S AND  1990S DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITIES. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INCREASED NUTRIENT  INPUTS AND A CHANGE IN THE NUTRIENT MIX EXCESSIVE ALGAL BLOOMS AND  CHANGES IN THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY COMPOSITION TOWARDS  NON-BIOMINERALIZING SPECIES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN MANY REGIONS. THIS HAS  IMPLICATIONS FOR FOODWEBS AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES OF COASTAL SEAS  INCLUDING THE RELEASE OF GREENHOUSE GASES. EXAMPLES FROM TROPICAL COASTS  WITH HIGH POPULATION DENSITY AND EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURE HOWEVER DISPLAY  DEVIATIONS FROM TEMPERATE AND SUBTROPICAL REGIONS IN THIS RESPECT.  ACCORDING TO INSTRUMENTAL RECORDS AND OBSERVATIONS THE PRESENT-DAY  BIOGEOCHEMICAL AND ECOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE APPEARS  TO BE ON THE ORDER OF DECADES. A SEDIMENT RECORD FROM THE BRAZILIAN  CONTINENTAL MARGIN SPANNING THE PAST 85000 YEARS HOWEVER DEPICTS THAT  THE ECOSYSTEM RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY CAN BE ON THE  ORDER OF 1000-2000 YEARS. THE COASTAL OCEAN CARBON CYCLE IS VERY  SENSITIVE TO ANTHROPOCENE CHANGES IN LAND-DERIVED CARBON AND NUTRIENT  FLUXES AND INCREASING ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE. AS OPPOSING TRENDS IN  HIGH LATITUDE REGIONS TROPICAL COASTAL SEAS DISPLAY INCREASING ORGANIC  MATTER INPUTS AND REDUCED CALCIFICATION RATES WHICH HAVE IMPORTANT  IMPLICATIONS FOR CALCIFYING ORGANISMS AND THE CARBON SOURCE OR SINK  FUNCTION OF THE COASTAL OCEAN. PARTICULARLY CORAL REEFS WHICH ARE  THRIVING IN WARM TROPICAL WATERS ARE SUFFERING FROM OCEAN ACIDIFICATION.  NEVERTHELESS THEY ARE NOT AFFECTED UNIFORMLY AND THE SENSITIVITY TO  OCEAN ACIDIFICATION MAY VARY LARGELY AMONG CORAL REEFS.

Here, we explored the spatial-temporal dynamics, diversity and interactions of variable and core bacterial populations associated with the coral Mussismilia hispida and the surrounding water. This survey was performed on five reefs along a transect from the coast (Reef 1) to offshore (Reef 5), representing a gradient of influence of the river mouth, for almost 12 months (4 sampling times), in the dry and rainy seasons. A clear increasing gradient of organic-pollution proxies (nitrogen content and fecal coliforms) was observed from Reef 1 to Reef 5, during both seasons, and was highest at the Buranh�m River mouth (Reef 1). Conversely, a clear inverse gradient of the network analysis of the whole bacterial communities also revealed more-complex network relationships at Reef 5. Our data also indicated a higher relative abundance of members of the bacterial core, dominated by Acinetobacter sp., at Reef 5, and higher diversity of site-stable bacterial populations, likely related to the higher abundance of total coliforms and N content (proxies of sewage or organic pollution) at Reef 1, during the rainy season. Thus, the less ""polluted"" areas may show a more-complex network and a high relative abundance of members of the bacterial core (almost 97% in some cases), resulting in a more-homogeneous and well-established bacteriome among sites/samples, when the influence of the river is stronger (rainy seasons).",LEITE DCA 2018 FRONT MICROBIOL,Coral Bacterial-Core Abundance and Network Complexity as Proxies for Anthropogenic Pollution,10.3389/fmicb.2018.00833,Leite,Frontiers in Microbiology,0.989247311827957,1

THIS STUDY PRESENTS TWO NEW SYSTEMS THAT PERMIT PRECISE POINT  SAMPLING OF MICRO- AND MESOZOOPLANKTON AND LARVAE OF INVERTEBRATES AND  FISH THE CHANNEL MIDWATER NEUSTON NET CMNN AND THE REEF EDGE NET  REN. BOTH ARE MOORED SYSTEMS THAT ARE EQUIPPED WITH 64- AND 300-MU M  MESH NETS. THE CMNN SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED FOR CONTINUOUS SAMPLING IN TIDAL  CHANNELS BETWEEN REEF PATCHES. IT SAMPLES AT THREE PRECISE DEPTH LAYERS  EPINEUSTON 0 M TO 0.075 M HYPONEUSTON 0.075 M TO 0.225 M1 M LAYER  0.925 M TO 1.075 M DEPTH. THE REN SYSTEM ALLOWS SAMPLING AT PRECISE  ADJUSTABLE DEPTHS AT GIVEN DISTANCES FROM THE REEF EDGE. THE OBJECTIVE  OF THE REN IS TO COLLECT ORGANISMS THAT ARE WASHED FROM REEF TOPS AND  REEF EDGES WITH THE EBB FLOW. THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE TWO NEW SYSTEMS  WAS EVALUATED AND COMPARED WITH RESULTS OBTAINED BY USING COMMON RING  NETS IN HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE TOWS. FIELDWORK WAS PERFORMED AT TWO REEF  PATCHES OF THE TAMANDARE REEF SYSTEM BRAZIL IN NOVEMBER 2015. THE CMNN  AND REN SHOWED SIMILAR PERFORMANCE IN COMPARISON WITH RING NET TOWS  CAPTURING MICROZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS VELIGER POLYCHAETE  DECAPOD AND BARNACLE LARVAE IN SIMILAR ABUNDANCES. FOR THE  MESOZOOPLANLCTON THE REN PRESENTED A SIMILAR PERFORMANCE TO THE RING  NET TOWS EFFICIENTLY CAPTURING DECAPOD CRUSTACEAN AND FISH LARVAE AS  WELL AS FISH EGGS. THE CMNN SHOWED LOWER ABUNDANCE OF DECAPOD LARVAE AND  FISH EGGS BUT SHOWED A GOOD PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUANTIFICATION OF FISH  LARVAE. THE TWO NEW PASSIVE NETS SHOWED A HIGH EFFECTIVENESS IN  COLLECTING LARVAE AND ADVANTAGES OVER TOWS WITH RING NETS SINCE THEY  STAY FOR SEVERAL HOURS CONTINUOUSLY CAPTURING LARVAL AGGREGATIONS DURING  SPAWNING EVENTS. THIS HIGH CAPTURING EFFICIENCY IS PROBABLY RELATED TO  THE AVOIDANCE OF SAMPLE REFLUX IN THE LONG NETS THAT SINK AND CLOSE AT  SLACK TIDE FOR THE CMNN AND DUE TO THE LONG TRAP-LIKE DESIGN WITH  FUNNEL-SHAPED INTERNAL ``ANTI-REFLUX'' NETS FOR THE REN.

The paleoecology was based on the distribution of benthic foraminifer functional groups associated with grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N and ?13C. The results identified three biosedimentary units showing that symbiont-bearing foraminifers (Peneroplis and Archaias) decrease in abundance. However, other small taxa (Miliolinella and Cornuspira) and stress-tolerant genera (Bolivina, Elphidium and Ammonia) increase in abundance toward the core top. Grain size decreases toward the top of the core, suggesting a weakening of hydrodynamic winnowing toward recent time. The TOC and TN concentrations increase, and the C/N ratios decrease, suggesting an increase of marine productivity from nearby goblet-shaped structures called ""chapeir�es"".

The scarcity of such information may be the result of the difficulty in sampling these habitats in meso- and macrotidal areas. Here, we attempted to gain a thorough understanding of fish cross-habitat movements and their migration patterns along tidal cycles by characterizing the structural roles that different mangrove microhabitats (e.g. forest and adjacent estuarine habitat) may have on fish assemblages. To achieve this, we placed underwater wide-angle cameras at different positions within the mangrove ecotone and sampled along entire tidal cycles within 15 mangrove habitats located along the Brazilian central coast. Our results showed that sequential patterns of fish occupancy (i.e. identity, diversity and abundance) were coupled to microhabitat characteristics, and those were contingent on the prevalent tidal stages. We observed clear species-specific associations forming distinct subassemblages along a tidal cycle. Mangrove edges, rather than any other habitat types, were pathways of fish migration. Our results revealed that, as a whole, the mangrove ecotone is used by the entire fish assemblage and that tidal cycles lead to sequential microhabitats use having strong structuring roles and leading to predictable subassemblages recombination. Such distinct ""assemblage-microhabitat"" couplings along tidal cycles highlight important interactive effects that these variables may have on migratory and fish behavioural patterns. Overall, we highlight that within mangroves, the benefits that fish receive from sequential microhabitat are highly context dependant and clearly reflect tidal effects.",REIS-FILHO JA 2016 MAR BIOL,Tidal migration and cross-habitat movements of fish assemblage within a mangrove ecotone,10.1007/s00227-016-2885-z,Reis-Filho,Marine Biology,0.98876404494382,1

THE IN SITU CAMPAIGNS WERE PERFORMED  IN 2016 DURING ALL SPRING SEASON SAND SUBSTRATA IN FOUR DISTINCT ZONES  WITH 26400 M 2 EACH ONE COVERING ALMOST ALL ADJACENT JETTY EXTENSION  TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE SPATIAL CHANGES IN THE MARINE DEBRIS COMPOSITION.  ALL MATERIAL OBTAINED WAS IDENTIFIED MEASURED WEIGHED AND ORDERED IN  EIGHT GROUPS WITH SIX GROUPS BEING RELATED TO THE FISHING ACTIVITY AND  TWO GROUPS RELATED TO THE TOURISM/COMMUNITY IN THE STUDY REGION. SO IT  WAS POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE POSSIBLE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE MARINE DEBRIS  DISTRIBUTION TO ARTISANAL AND RECREATIONAL LOCAL FISHING. AFTER 600  FREEDIVING SAMPLING EFFORTS 2142 MARINE DEBRIS ITEMS WERE OBTAINED  TOTALING CLOSE TO 100 KG OF SOLID WASTE REMOVED FROM THE INNER PORTION  OF THE COASTAL JETTY. NOTABLY 1752 UNITS 50 KG OF FISHING LEADS WERE  COLLECTED BEING THIS ITEM THE MAIN MARINE DEBRIS RESIDUE FOUND IN THE  FOUR SAMPLED AREAS CORRESPONDING TO NEARLY 50\% OF THE TOTAL WEIGHT OF  THE COLLECTED WASTE. NINETY-EIGHT PERCENT OF MARINE DEBRIS WERE DERIVED  FROM THE LOCAL FISHING ACTIVITIES AND JUST 2\% WERE DERIVED FROM  TOURISM/COMMUNITY. CONSIDERING THE TOTAL CONTRIBUTION RELATED TO  FISHING 83\% OF THE MARINE DEBRIS WERE COMPOSED BY LEAD SINKERS  ADOPTED BY RECREATIONAL AND ARTISANAL FISHING. NOTABLY THE CATCH  ACTIVITY IN THIS REGION HAS A CLOSE INFLUENCE OVER THE MARINE DEBRIS  COMPOSITION. REDUCTIONS OF MARINE DEBRIS EMISSIONS DERIVED FROM THE  FISHING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN A GLOBAL CHALLENGE ONCE THIS PROBLEM IS  OCCURRING IN PRACTICALLY ALL MARINE AND ESTUARINE ENVIRONMENTS UNDER THE  ANTHROPIC ACTION. THE PRESENCE OF MARINE DEBRIS CHANGES THE LOCAL  LANDSCAPE AND CAN PROVOKE SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS GHOST  FISHING THAT AFFECTS A WIDE VARIABILITY OF MARINE MAMMALS BIRDS AND  FISHES. MOST OF MARINE DEBRIS COLLECTED CAME FROM RECREATIONAL AND  ARTISANAL FISHING BEING THE FISHING LEADS THE MOST PROMINENT MATERIAL  ESPECIALLY IN SECTOR 4. THIS FACT IS POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE INTENSE  MULLET FISHING USING CAST NETS USUAL IN THIS SAMPLE AREA. IN THE OTHER  SECTORS THERE WAS A GREAT PREDOMINANCE OF GRAPNEL FISHING LEADS WIDELY  ADOPTED BY RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN IN OPEN WATER ENVIRONMENTS.

SMALLER S.AXILLARE JUVENILES  <5CM PREFERRED TO INHABIT THE MACROALGAL BEDS AND THE REEF FLAT  WHEREAS JUVENILES LARGER THAN 5CM WERE MORE ABUNDANT IN THE BACK AND  FORE REEFS DUE TO DISTINCT POST-SETTLEMENT HABITAT CONDITIONS.  AGGRESSIVE INTERACTIONS WITH THE TERRITORIAL DAMSELFISH STEGASTES FUSCUS  WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVING FACTOR OF JUVENILE DISTRIBUTION AND FEEDING  RATES. ATTACK RATES INCREASED WITH JUVENILE SIZE AND THE LOWEST BITE  RATES WERE OBSERVED IN ZONES WITH HIGHER DENSITIES OF TERRITORIAL  DAMSELFISH. IN PREVIOUS STUDIES THE PERSISTENCE OF PARROTFISH RECRUITS  IN HABITATS DOMINATED BY DAMSELFISH WAS REDUCED BUT NEWLY SETTLED  PARROTFISH OCCURRED MORE DENSELY WITHIN THE DAMSELFISH DOMAIN BY  BEHAVING AS A CRYPTIC REEF FISH. AS THESE JUVENILES GREW THEIR BITE  RATES INCREASED A CHANGE ASSOCIATED WITH A SHIFT FROM CRYPTIC TO ROVING  BEHAVIOR. FEEDING PREFERENCES WERE DETERMINED BY SUBSTRATE COVER WHERE  JUVENILES FED ON AVAILABLE FOOD SOURCES IN EACH HABITAT.

1659,SOARES LSH 2018 OCEAN COAST MANAG,2018,Fish feeding interactions in a subtropical coastal system in the southwestern Atlantic ,Trophic network Fish Stomach content Coastal system Southeastern Brazil,"Feeding interactions, which determine the dynamics, productivity and stability of an ecosystem to a large extent, constitute fundamental knowledge for understanding the functionality of an ecosystem. Within an integrated working context, this study aimed to identify the major prey for the fish species of Arac?a? Bay through an analysis of stomach contents. Arac?a? Bay is a sheltered, low tide terrace that presents seasonal hydrodynamics, primary productivity and organism communities. A total of 1253 stomachs from 28 fish species were sampled in March 2013 and January 2014 (austral summer) and in June 2013 (austral winter). A hierarchical cluster analysis (Bray-Curtis similarity index) was performed on the matrix of the index of relative importance (IRI%) of the food items of 15 species collected in both seasons. Five and four major trophic groups were recorded for the summer and winter, respectively (SIMPROF). A two-way PERMANOVA test showed significant differences in the prey compositions among the trophic groups but not the seasons. The annual dendrogram showed four trophic groups: shrimp feeders (8 species), teleostean fish feeders (2 species), copepod feeders (2 species), and benthic invertebrate feeders (3 species). Seasonal species shifts among the trophic groups related to the seasonal recruitment of relatively abundant fish species during the summer were recorded mainly between the teleostean fish feeder and shrimp feeder groups. Overall, the seasonal dynamics of the waters and the consequent prey abundance influenced the resource availability. Resource partitioning and feeding plasticity allowed the species to optimize the use of available prey in the bay. These results represent a contribution toward understanding the local food web, to construct a trophic model, and to contribute to its sustainable integrated management.",,Fish feeding interactions in a subtropical coastal system in the southwestern Atlantic,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2018.04.002,Soares,Ocean & Coastal Management,0.988505747126437,1

THESE ELEMENTS OCCUR IN TWO TYPES OF SHALLOW MARINE SEDIMENTS CARBONATE  MAINLY AUTOCHTHONOUS AND SILICICLASTICS  TERRIGENOUS/ALLOCHTHONOUS/RELICT. WITH RESPECT TO THE CHEMICAL  ELEMENTS A STRONG NEGATIVE CORRELATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN CALCAREOUS  CA AND SR AND SILICICLASTIC SI AL AND K COMPONENTS. STRONTIUM DOES  NOT ALWAYS SHOW A STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH CA. THE AVERAGE CACO3  CONTENTS OF 81\% AND 91\% WERE DETERMINED FOR THE HB AND TP  RESPECTIVELY. THE PROFILES SHOW A PREDOMINANCE OF CARBONATE SEDIMENTS  HOWEVER THE HB DEMONSTRATES A GREATER CONTINENTAL INFLUENCE INNER  SHELF. THE GRAIN SIZE PRESENTS A PREVALENCE OF SAND 82\% IN RELATION  TO GRAVEL 18\%. THIS PARTICLE SIZE VARIATION IS MAINLY DUE TO THE  BREAKDOWN OF HALIMEDA NODULES SILICICLASTIC SEDIMENTS IN THE FINER  FRACTION >2.54 PHI AND THE PRESENCE OF GRAVEL WITH IRON COATING  RELICT. TWO TYPES OF ECHO-CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. BOTH ARE  ASSOCIATED WITH THE LARGE PRESENCE OF CARBONATE SEDIMENTS. ECHO I SHOWS  THE BOTTOM SURFACE WITH CONTINUITY IN THE SUB-BOTTOM WITHOUT A  SUBSURFACE REFLECTOR. ECHO II PRESENTS A DISCONTINUOUS SUBSURFACE  REFLECTOR. THE ROV ALLOWED THE OBSERVATION OF ALGAE PATCHES IN HIGHER  FLOORS AND GRAVELLY AND SANDY BIOCLASTICS IN THE LOWEST SECTORS. LARGE  PATCHES OF CALCAREOUS GREEN ALGAE HALIMEDA OCCUR IN THE INNER SHELF  BELOW THE 15 M ISOBATH MAINLY DUE TO THE SEMI-ARID CLIMATE WEAK  SEDIMENT SUPPLY FROM THE MAINLAND GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION EQUATORIAL  AND OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS HYDRODYNAMIC AND BIOGEOCHEMISTRY. IT HAS  BEEN CONCLUDED THAT THE SEAFLOOR OF THE SEMI-ARID CONTINENTAL SHELF OF  EAST CEARA NE BRAZIL SHOWS MODERN PREDOMINANCE OF CARBONATE DEPOSITION  BASED ON THE LACK OF CONTAMINANTS GEOCHEMICAL PURITY OF CARBONATE  SEDIMENTS AND HIGH PERCENTAGE OF CACO3.

WE EVALUATE THE  DENSITY-BANDING PATTERN OF THE CORAL MUSSISMILIA BRAZILIENSIS TO  CALIBRATE IT FOR USE AS A PROXY OF PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS SUCH AS  TEMPERATURE AND LIGHT AVAILABILITY. COLONIES OF THE CORAL WERE STAINED  WITH ALIZARIN RED IN THE FIELD AND IN AN AQUARIUM SYSTEM TO DETERMINE  THE PERIODICITY AND CYCLICITY OF THE SKELETAL DENSITY BANDING AND TO  DETERMINE WHETHER THIS CORAL SPECIES PRESENTS BANDING PATTERN  CHARACTERISTICS USEFUL AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROXY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT  M. BRAZILIENSIS FORMS ANNUAL DENSITY BANDS IN NATURE THAT COMPRISE A  PAIR OF HIGH- AND LOW-DENSITY BANDS LIGHT AND DARK BANDS RESPECTIVELY  IN NEGATIVE X-RADIOGRAPHY. FURTHERMORE M.

IN A TIME SERIES 1997 TO 2005 OF M.  BRAZILIENSIS GROWTH OBSERVED IN CORE SLABS AND COLLECTED IN ABROLHOS NO  SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE WIDTHS OF THE LOW AND HIGH DENSITY BANDS  WAS OBSERVED ALTHOUGH CLEAR ASYMMETRY WAS OBSERVED IN THE TEMPERATURE  SEASONALITY.

THE HIGH TURBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY HOLOCENE SHELF FLOODING SHOULD  ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ABSENCE OF M. BRAZILIENSIS DURING THE  INITIAL STAGES OF REEF BUILDUP IN BRAZIL.

Sampling sites were distributed between sides of the island facing the continent (North) and ocean (South) across two depth-dependent substrates. As proved by ordination and permutation analyses, these two factors accounted for nearly half the variation observed among assemblages, either with species abundance or coverage area data. Out of 46 OTUs surveyed (~ 3000 individuals), Tedania (Tedania) ignis, Scopalina ruetzleri, and Iotrochota arenosa dominated the community, even though most of the dissimilarity detected among assemblages relied on 20% of the OTUs. The northern side was proved as more diverse, and the south-facing side held more unspecific, putatively new OTUs. Assemblages dwelling on rocky-to-sandy interface bottoms were meager in species number, although they mainly included Dragmacidon reticulatum and the endemic Brazilian sponge Polymastia janeirensis.

Connectivity of MPAs through larval dispersal influences recruitment, population dynamics, genetic structure and biogeography in coral reef ecosystems. Connectivity of protected reef ecosystem in the ECS was investigated with a hydrodynamic model (ROMS) forcing an Individual Based Model (IBM-Ichthyop), and used groupers (genus Mycteroperca) as functional group. The hydrodynamic output from ROMS was compared with satellite data and showed good agreement with observed surface fields. Eggs were released, in IBM experiments, from April to September along six years (2002-2007) in five MPAs along the ECS. Intrannual variability in recruitment and self-recruitment of grouper larvae was observed, as well as a negative correlation of these population parameters with total Kinetic Energy (KE) used as a metric of the physical environment. Higher KE leads to increased offshore advection of larvae, reduced total recruitment and connectivity of MPAs. Our results indicate high and uni-directional connectivity between MPAs from north to south influenced by the Brazil Current flowing in the same direction.

This study aimed to survey the benthic animal biodiversity of the Pirapama shipwreck, located 23 m deep and six miles off Recife harbor. From 2001 to 2007, species were observed, photographed and collected through scuba diving. The material was later sorted and identified in the laboratory. A total of 76 sessile and sedentary animal taxa were recorded belonging to the following phyla: Porifera (Demospongiae and Calcarea), Cnidaria (Hydrozoa and Anthozoa), Mollusca (Bivalvia and Gastropoda), Annelida (Polychaeta), Arthropoda (Cirripedia), Bryozoa (Gymnolaemata), Echinodermata (Asteroidea and Echinoidea), and Chordata (Ascidiacea). The greatest richness was for Porifera and Bryozoa - 13 listed species for each. Eleven new occurrences were recorded for the state of Pernambuco, the hydroid Halopteris polymorpha and ten bryozoan species, one of them being the first record for Brazil (Scrupocellaria curacaoensis).

This study analyses Brazilian MOF legislation as a tool for conservation. Brazil's legal framework includes participation in international agreements, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), as well as administrative measures that regulate the capture of certain species in Brazil. However, compared with the laws that pertain to terrestrial fauna, Brazil's MOF legislation remains limited and possibly lacks the necessary technical and scientific foundation. There is a trend to prohibit the capture of organisms according to the criterion of ""rarity"". The legislation also includes the use of ""positive lists"", which identify which species may be caught and establish maximum individual capture and trade quotas. Nevertheless, the criteria used to determine the quotas are not established a priori and apparently defined without scientific rigour. In this context, it is impossible to affirm that Brazilian MOF legislation fulfils its function as an instrument for the conservation of MOF stocks.",FERRAZ SAMPAIO FD 2013 MAR POL,Brazilian environmental legislation as tool to conserve marine ornamental fish,10.1016/j.marpol.2013.03.009,Duarte Ferraz Sampaio,Marine Policy,0.987341772151899,0.285714285714286

SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS WERE ANALYSED BASED ON LITERATURE  RECORDS AND MATERIAL DEPOSITED AT BRAZILIAN AND AMERICAN COLLECTIONS.  RESULTS RECENT ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT ABOUT 12\% OF THE BRAZILIAN REEF  FISH SPECIES ARE ENDEMIC AND MOST ICHTHYOLOGISTS AGREE THAT THIS  ENDEMISM IS GENERATED BY THE BARRIER FORMED BY THE FRESHWATER AND  SEDIMENT DISCHARGE OF LARGE RIVERS IN NORTH-EASTERN SOUTH AMERICA  MAINLY THE AMAZON ORINOCO AND THEIR TRIBUTARIES. HOWEVER LITTLE IS  KNOWN ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF THIS BARRIER AND RECENT STUDIES HAVE  DEMONSTRATED THAT IT CAN BE CROSSED THROUGH DEEP SPONGE BOTTOMS ON THE  OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF OFF NORTH-EASTERN SOUTH AMERICA. MOREOVER THE  RECENT DISCOVERY OF SPECIES REGARDED AS BRAZILIAN ENDEMICS IN THE  EXTREME SOUTHERN CARIBBEAN IS SHOWING THAT THE AMAZON BARRIER IS WEAKER  THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.  MAIN CONCLUSIONS THE AMAZON FRESHWATER AND SEDIMENT OUTFLOW IS A STRONG  BARRIER TO SHALLOW WATER REEF FISH AND OTHER ORGANISMS AND IT IS  PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE ENDEMISM FOUND IN BRAZILIAN COASTAL  HABITATS.

The mesozooplankton associated with the pelagic realm over the reef formation was characterized, considering the estuarine plume and oceanic influence. Vertical hauls were carried out using a standard plankton net with 200 ?m mesh size during September 2014. An indicator index was applied to express species importance as ecological indicators in community. Information on functional traits was gathered for the most abundant copepod species. Overall, 179 zooplankton taxa were recorded. Copepods were the richest (92 species), most diverse and most abundant group, whereas meroplankton were rare and less abundant. Species diversity (>3.0 bits.ind-1) and evenness (>0.6) were high, indicating a complex community. Small holoplanktonic species dominated the zooplankton, and the total density varied from 107.98 ind. m-3 over the reef area to 2,609.24 ind. m-3 in the estuarine plume, with a significant difference between coastal and oceanic areas. The most abundant copepods were the coastal species ithona plumifera and Clausocalanus furcatus and early stages copepodites of Paracalanidae. The holoplanktonic Oikopleura, an important producer of mucous houses, was very abundant on the reefs. The indicator species index revealed three groups: (1) indicative of coastal waters under the influence of the estuarine plume [Euterpina acutifrons, Parvocalanus crassirostris, Oikopleura (Vexillaria) dioica and Hydromedusae]; (2) characterized coastal and oceanic conditions (Clausocalanus); (3) characterized the reef system (O. plumifera). Two major copepods functional groups were identified and sorted according to their trophic strategy and coastal-oceanic distribution. The species that dominated the coastal area and the area over the rhodolith beds are indicators of the estuarine plume and are mixed with species of the North Brazil Current. These species practically disappear offshore, where occur oceanic species commonly found in other oligotrophic tropical areas. This ecosystem shows a mixture of estuarine, coastal and oceanic communities coexisting in the waters over the Amazon reefs, with no significant differences among these areas. However, the MDS clearly separated the communities along the salinity gradient in the plume.",NEUMANN-LEITAO S 2018 FRONT MICROBIOL,Zooplankton From a Reef System Under the Influence of the Amazon River Plume,10.3389/fmicb.2018.00355,Neumann-Leitão,Frontiers in Microbiology,0.987012987012987,0.928571428571429

IT  AFFECTS LIGHT AVAILABILITY AND WILL ACT TOGETHER WITH GLOBAL SEA LEVEL  RISE TO REDUCE POTENTIAL PHOTOSYNTHESIS THAT IS IMPORTANT TO  LIGHT-ENHANCED CALCIFICATION IN CORALS. CORALS ARE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS  TO THE MORPHOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY OF REEFS THROUGH SKELETAL CALCIFICATION.  BIOCONSTRUCTION BY CORALS IS A MULTIFACTORIAL PROCESS THAT IS CONTROLLED  BY PHYSICAL E.G. IRRADIANCE AND TURBIDITY AND BIOLOGICAL FACTORS SUCH  AS PHOTOACCLIMATION PROCESS. IN THIS PAPER WE INTEND TO SHOW HOW  TURBIDITY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY MIGHT INTERPLAY TO PRODUCE A CORAL SPECIES  DISTRIBUTION THAT CONTROLS REEF GROWTH AND STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY. THE  ABROLHOS COMPLEX IS COMPOSED BY A GROUP OF REEFS CLOSER TO THE COASTLINE  CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LIGHT ATTENUATION VALUE KD490 = 0.11 AND  ANOTHER ONE ABOUT 60 KM FAR FROM THE COAST CHARACTERIZED BY A LIGHT  ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT OF KD490 = 0.08.

CORAL SPECIES COVER AND DISTRIBUTION DATA WERE  USED TO ESTIMATE REEF BIOCONSTRUCTION [SENSU DONE 1995] RATES. A field experiment examined the metabolic function of five species (Mussismilia braziliensis, Mussismilia hispida, Mussismilia harttii, Montastraea cavernosa and Siderastrea stellata) through respirometry and rapid light curves (RLC). Bioconstruction potential and primary gross productivity demonstrated a substantial variability between reefs and species. In combination, these functional responses meant that coral species distribution is controlled by local factors and acclimation process. Therefore, our results suggest that these functional responses are useful tools to understand photoacclimation process and its consequences, species distribution and the space occupation on Abrolhos bank.

THIS SPECIES IS A COLONIAL MASSIVE ZOOXANTHELLATE CORAL AND  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REEF BUILDERS IN MANY REEF AREAS. THE  PHOTOSYNTHETIC SYMBIONTS ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATIONS  SUCH AS SEDIMENTATION AND TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS WHICH CAN DISTURB THE  COMPLEX INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ANIMAL HOST AND ENDOSYMBIONT. IN THIS  STUDY WE SIMULATED THE CONDITIONS FOUND IN THE FIELD IN A SERIES OF  EXPERIMENTS THAT EVALUATED CHLOROPHYLL A FLUORESCENCE EMISSIONS.

THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE BROAD CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES WILL  LIKELY REQUIRE LARGE AREAS AND STRETCH LIMITED FUNDS FOR MPA  IMPLEMENTATION. WE UNDERTOOK A SPATIAL PRIORITISATION OF BRAZILIAN CORAL  REEFS THAT CONSIDERED TWO TYPES OF CONSERVATION ZONES I.E. NO-TAKE AND  MULTIPLE USE AREAS AND INTEGRATED MULTIPLE CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES INTO  MPA PLANNING WHILE ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF DIFFERENT SETS OF  OBJECTIVES ON IMPLEMENTATION COSTS. WE DEVISED OBJECTIVES FOR  BIODIVERSITY CONNECTIVITY AND RESILIENCE TO GLOBAL WARMING DETERMINED  THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXISTING MPAS ACHIEVED THEM AND DESIGNED  COMPLEMENTARY ZONING TO ACHIEVE ALL OBJECTIVES COMBINED IN EXPANDED MPA  SYSTEMS. IN DOING SO WE EXPLORED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SETS OF  OBJECTIVES DETERMINED WHETHER REFINEMENTS TO THE EXISTING SPATIAL  ARRANGEMENT OF MPAS WERE NECESSARY AND TESTED THE UTILITY OF EXISTING  MPAS BY COMPARING THEIR COST EFFECTIVENESS WITH AN MPA SYSTEM DESIGNED  FROM SCRATCH. WE FOUND THAT MPAS IN BRAZIL PROTECT SOME ASPECTS OF CORAL  REEF BIODIVERSITY PATTERN E.G. THREATENED FAUNA AND ECOSYSTEM TYPES  MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN CONNECTIVITY OR RESILIENCE TO GLOBAL WARMING.  EXPANDING THE EXISTING MPA SYSTEM WAS AS COST-EFFECTIVE AS DESIGNING ONE  FROM SCRATCH ONLY WHEN MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES WERE CONSIDERED AND  MANAGEMENT COSTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR.

TO ASSESS TRAMPLING IMPACT TWO  AREAS WERE COMPARED A PROTECTED AREA AND AN AREA SUBJECT TO INTENSIVE  TOURISM. DENSITIES OF TOTAL HARPACTICOIDA AND OF THE MOST ABUNDANT  HARPACTICOID SPECIES SHOWED STRONG REDUCTIONS IN THE TRAMPLED AREA. AN  ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE REVEALED THAT THE LOSS OF PHYTAL HABITAT WAS NOT  THE MAIN SOURCE OF DENSITY REDUCTIONS SHOWING THAT TRAMPLING AFFECTED  THE ANIMALS DIRECTLY. IN ADDITION MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED  DIFFERENCES IN THE STRUCTURE OF HARPACTICOID ASSEMBLAGES BETWEEN AREAS.

Rhodoliths are unattached, branching, crustose benthic marine red algae; they provide habitat for a rich variety of marine invertebrates. The resultant excavation is relevant to sediment production, while is common that the fragments or the whole specimens result in vast fossil deposits formed by rich material that can be ""mined"" for biological and geological data. Accordingly, microtomography (?CT) may enable a detailed investigation of biological and geological signatures preserved within the rhodolith structure in a non-destructive approach that is especially relevant when analyzing herbaria collections or rare samples. Therefore, we prepared coralline algae samples and submitted them to a range of capabilities provided by the SkyScan1176 micro-CT scanner, including reconstruction, virtual slicing, and pinpointing biological and geological signatures. To this end, polychaetes and mollusk shells, or their excavations, coral nucleation, sediment deposits and conceptacles were all observed. Although a similar technique has been applied previously to samples of living rhodoliths in Brazil, we show, for the first time, its successful application to fossil rhodoliths. We also provide a detailed working protocol and discuss the advantages and limitations of the microtomography within the rhodoliths.",TORRANO-SILVA BN 2015 MICRON,Unveiling privacy: Advances in microtomography of coralline algae,10.1016/j.micron.2015.02.004,Torrano-Silva,Micron,0.984615384615385,1

THESE ARE TAKEN FROM BLOCKS  EXCAVATED ACROSS A REEF-FRONT/ REEF-CREST/ REEF-FLAT SECTION IN THE  WINDWARD TRANSECT AND A REEF-CREST / REEF-FLAT SECTION IN THE LEEWARD  TRANSECT. THE MAIN SUBSTRATE AVAILABLE FOR ENCRUSTATION IS THE DOMINANT  PRIMARY FRAMEWORKING-BUILDING CORALLINE ALGA POROLITHON CF PACHYDERMUM.  THE DIVERSITY NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OF COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG  ENCRUSTERS INCREASE FROM REEF-FRONT AND REEF-CREST TO REEF-FLAT IN BOTH  TRANSECTS. VERMETID GASTROPODS AND HOMOTREMATID AND ACERVULINID  FORAMINIFERANS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SECONDARY FRAMEWORK BUILDERS IN  THE SURVEYED REEFS.

TO AVOID POTENTIAL  BIAS BECAUSE OF TAXONOMIC PROBLEMS OR MISIDENTIFICATION WE ONLY  INCLUDED FAMILIES TAXONOMICALLY WELL DOCUMENTED WITH CONSPICUOUS  SPECIES AND RELATIVELY EASY TO IDENTIFY.  RESULTS THE LOW-LEVEL DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN CARIBBEAN AND BRAZILIAN  SPECIES/POPULATIONS AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OF RESTRICTED POPULATIONS  OF A FEW NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN SPECIES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AMAZON  RIVER CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THIS BARRIER TO DISPERSION CAN BE  OCCASIONALLY BRIDGED. TRANSOCEANIC DISPERSAL APPEARS TO BE FREQUENT AND  TO OCCUR ALONG THREE ROUTES FROM THE CARIBBEAN TO NORTH EAST ATLANTIC  FROM NORTHERN BRAZIL TO THE GULF OF GUINEA AND FROM AFRICA TO SOUTHERN  BRAZIL.

On the other hand, other goods and services provided by these environments such as nurseries habitats, fishing and climate regulation remain undersized. Besides directly CaCO3 exploitation, these diverse ecosystems within the Brazilian economic exclusive zone are often covering potentially sites for oil and gas extraction. The IBAMA (Environmental Agency of the Brazilian government) have been applying the precautionary principle to deny requests for oil/gas drilling activities where rhodolith beds occur. Here, we discuss recent data about diversity associated with rhodoliths and also record the ""rare"" worm Nuchalosyllis cf. maiteae. More than the distribution of one only species, our finding is an emblematic example of our infancy knowledge state about diversity associated with rhodolith beds in southwestern Atlantic.

LARGE-SCALE BEDFORMS CONSIST OF I BIOCLASTIC  MAINLY CORALLINE ALGAE AND HALIMEDA SAND RIBBONS 5-10 KM LONG 50-600  M WIDE PARALLEL TO THE SHORELINE AND II VERY LARGE TRANSVERSE  SILICICLASTIC DUNES 3.4 KM LONG ON AVERAGE 840 M SPACING AND 3-8 M  HIGH WITH TROUGHS THAT GRADE RAPIDLY INTO CARBONATE SANDS AND GRAVELS.  WAVE RIPPLES ARE SUPERPOSED ON ALL LARGE-SCALE BEDFORMS AND INDICATE AN  ONSHORE SHELF SEDIMENT TRANSPORT NORMAL TO THE MAIN SEDIMENT TRANSPORT  DIRECTION. THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE LARGE-SCALE BEDFORMS IS PRIMARILY  DETERMINED BY THE NORTHWESTERLY FLOWING RESIDUAL OCEANIC AND TIDAL  CURRENTS RESULTING MAINLY IN COAST-PARALLEL TRANSPORT. MODELS OF SHELF  BEDFORM FORMATION PREDICT SAND RIBBONS TO OCCUR IN HIGHER ENERGY  SETTINGS RATHER THAN IN LARGE DUNES. HOWEVER IN THE STUDY AREA SAND  RIBBONS OCCUR IN AN AREA OF COARSE LOW-DENSITY AND EASILY TRANSPORTABLE  BIOCLASTIC SANDS AND GRAVELS COMPARED WITH THE VERY LARGE TRANSVERSE  DUNES IN AN OFFSHORE AREA THAT IS COMPOSED OF DENSER MEDIUM-GRAINED  SILICICLASTIC SANDS. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF DIFFERENT  SEDIMENT TYPES IS LIKELY TO EXERT AN INFLUENCE ON THE NATURE OF THE  BEDFORMS GENERATED. THE OFFSHORE SAND SUPPLY IS TIME LIMITED AND  ORIGINATES FROM SEA FLOOR EROSION OF SANDSTONES OF FORMER SEA-LEVEL  LOWSTANDS.

Most southwestern Atlantic reefs are characterized by high sedimentation. However, there are no temporal series of sediment deposition rates. We evaluated sediment deposition, the sediment carbonate composition and coral and zoanthid covers on six reefs in Brazil over four-years. Sediment deposition rates varied from near zero to 233 mg cm-2 day-1, with peaks between August and December, and yearly averages ranging from nine to 104 mg cm-2 day-1. Deposition rates presented site-specific correlations with wind, indicating that resuspension must be a major factor. The presence of carbonates varied from 38% to 90%, with two sites showing seasonal differences. Benthic communities were fairly similar among sites, but the analyses suggested particular frequencies at each site. There was no significant correlation between sediment and benthic communities. However, Palythoa caribaeorum usually occur in high sediment deposition areas. Our results did not corroborate previous data that suggested that a 10 mg cm-2 day-1 would be a ""critical limit for coral survival"".

These fishes dwell in a wide range of habitats, but most studies on parrotfish feeding behavior and ecology have been made on coral reef sites. We report on parrotfishes with damaged dentition at Fernando de Noronha, a volcanic archipelago off the coast of northeast Brazil, in the tropical southwest Atlantic Ocean. We recorded tooth damage only in adult individuals (>40 cm total length [TL]) of 3 common species (Sparisoma amplum, S. axillare and S. frondosum) in the study area. The frequency of tooth damage varied among the species: 0.85% in S. amplum, 2.34% in S. axillare and 0.76% in S. frondosum. Two types of tooth damage were recorded: broken teeth and the whole dental plate protruding from the mouth. Individuals with damaged dentition were recorded at 6 out of 10 study sites. The abundance of parrotfishes with tooth damage and their presence at several sites within the archipelago indicate that this is a common and predictable event in the area. The reefs of Fernando de Noronha Archipelago comprise mostly basaltic rocks, which are much harder than the calcium carbonate matrix that generally composes coral reefs where most studies on parrotfish behavior and ecology have been conducted. This may explain the absence of reports of parrotfishes with damaged teeth in the scientific literature to date.",BONALDO RM 2007 MAR ECOL -PROG SER,"Dentition damage in parrotfishes feeding on hard surfaces at Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, southwest Atlantic Ocean",10.3354/meps342249,Bonaldo,Marine Ecology Progress Series,0.983050847457627,1

STUDY OF THE  SEQUENCE GEOMETRIES REVEAL SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT GEOMETRIC RESPONSES  TO CHANGES IN RELATIVE SEA LEVEL OF INTERVALS DOMINATED BY CARBONATES TO  INTERVALS DOMINATED BY SILICICLASTICS. USING THE GEOMETRICAL SHELF BREAK  AS A REFERENCE POINT AGGRADATION AND PROGRADATION RATES FOR THE  CARBONATE AND SILICICLASTIC DEPOSITIONAL SYSTEMS WERE MEASURED. IN  SILICICLASTICS THE LATERAL POSITION OF THE MARGIN REMAINS ROUGHLY  STATIONARY WITH RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL RISES IN THE ORDER OF 30 M/MY. AT  HIGHER RATES THE MARGIN RETREATS AT LOWER RATES IT PROGRADES. CARBONATE  MARGINS REMAIN STATIONARY OR SLIGHTLY PROGRADATIONAL EVEN WITH RELATIVE  SEA-LEVEL RISES OF UP TO 100 M/MY THE FASTEST RATES OBSERVED IN THIS  STUDY. THIS ILLUSTRATES THE STRONG TENDENCY OF CARBONATE PLATFORMS TO  STACK THEIR MARGINS AND KEEP UP WITH RELATIVE RISES IN SEA LEVEL RATHER  THAN GRADUALLY RETREAT LANDWARD AS DO SILICICLASTICS. THIS OBSERVATION  MAY EXPLAIN WHY CARBONATE PLATFORMS PREFERENTIALLY TRY TO DEFEND A  MARGIN PRIOR TO ULTIMATE BACKSTEPPING. THE HIGH AGGRADATION POTENTIAL OF  CARBONATE MARGINS ALSO GIVES ONLAP AND DOWNLAP TERMINATION PATTERNS ON  SEISMIC PROFILES WHERE CARBONATE PLATFORMS DEVELOP ON SLOPING  SILICICLASTIC SHELVES. THE RESULTING UNCONFORMITIES ARE A RESULT OF  DIFFERENCES IN SEDIMENT DISPERSAL BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS AND NOT  NECESSARILY FROM CHANGES OF RELATIVE SEA LEVEL. C 2005 ELSEVIER B.V.

The aim was to test the hypothesis that the fish community structure changes seasonally, associated with seasonal changes in environmental conditions, and that changes occurred between the two yearly periods because of increased anthropogenic activities. The sampling protocol for the two surveys was identical. A total of 63 species was recorded, with 38 species occurring in 2002-2003, and 53 species in 2008-2009. The main changes in the mangrove's fish assemblage between 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 were (i) an increase in species richness, fish density and total biomass; and (ii) an increase in the zoobenthivorous species of gerreids Eucinostomus argenteus , Diapterus rhombeus and Ulaema lefroyi , and a decrease in the planktivorous clupeid Harengula clupeola . Other abundant species, such as the opportunistic atherinopsid. Atherinella brasiliensis , the detritivorous mullet Mugil liza and the zoobenthivorous pufferfish Sphoeroides testudineus did not differ in abundance between the two yearly periods. Ten species occurred only in 2002-2003, and 23 species only in 2008-2009, indicating significant changes in community structure over the 6-year period. Seasonal changes in community structure were more conspicuous in 2008-2009, when species abundance and richness were greatest. The highest fish abundance was recorded in spring and in summer/early fall, and the lowest in late fall/winter.

Colonial ascidians consist, exclusively, of brooding species, with lecithotrophic larvae that have a limited dispersal. As a result, there is a marked differentiation among populations. In this work, we used allozyme electrophoresis to access the genetic variation in four populations of Symplegma rubra, a colonial ascidian frequently found in the intertidal zone of Southeastern Brazilian coast. High variability was found at three of the four sites sampled, the exception being Praia Grande in the State of Rio de Janeiro. At this site, there was a great preponderance of clones, which possibly reflected the enclosed nature of the location and its low water circulation that reduce the dispersal capabilities of these animals. S. rubra did not conform to expectations for random mating (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium): there was a deficit of heterozygotes that was more related to the small population size than to inbreeding processes, since F is analysis per locus revealed a deficiency of heterozygotes at only one locus-MDH*. The greatest variation in allele frequency was found for GPI-2*. Analyses of genetic variability revealed moderate differentiation among the populations (F ST=0.051), which was unexpected for a species with a low dispersal capability. Rafting, a frequently underestimated means of dispersal, may be the main mode of gene flow in this species over large areas, since colonies of S. rubra are frequently seen growing on drift material and there is no evidence that the larva survive for a long time in the plankton.",DIAS GM 2006 MAR BIOL,"Low genetic differentiation between isolated populations of the colonial ascidian Symplegma rubra Monniot, C. 1972",10.1007/s00227-005-0111-5,Dias,Marine Biology,0.982456140350877,1

The data were obtained through semi-structured interviews conducted with 60 fishers from the fishing community of Guaxindiba (21�29'S, 41�00'W), which is associated with the Z-1 fishers' colony. Eighty-nine species were cited by the fishers and 44.1% are important commercial fish in the region. The fishers cited five distinct zones used to fish: border zone (68 species), estuary (41 spp.), artificial reef (27 spp.), ""malacacheta"" (24 spp.), and open ocean (10 spp.). The fishery resources were classified according to their gastronomic and economic characteristics: primary fish (35 spp.), secondary fish (32 spp.), mixed fish (10 spp.), discarded fish (7 spp.), and fish used as bait (5 spp.). The price of the target species increases along the production chain due to the greater number of people involved, processing costs, and improvement of the product. The data from this study can contribute to local fisheries management and point out to the use of artificial reefs in the maintenance of fishery resources in northern Rio de Janeiro.",LIMA JS 2019 BIOTA NEOTROP,Ethnoecology and socioeconomic around an artificial reef: the case of artisanal fisheries from southeastern Brazil,10.1590/1676-0611-bn-2018-0620,Lima,Biota Neotropica,0.982456140350877,1

WE AIM TO STUDY THE LOCAL ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE THAT  BRAZILIAN COASTAL FISHERS HAVE ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS SEASON  PLACES AND MIGRATION OF 13 COASTAL FISH SPECIES OF COMMERCIAL  IMPORTANCE. WE SELECTED FISHERMEN WITH MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF FISHING  PRACTICE AND WE INTERVIEWED A TOTAL OF 67 FISHERMEN 29 FROM THE  SOUTHEASTERN COAST FROM THE COMMUNITIES OF PURUBA ALMADA PICINGUABA  AND BERTIOGA AND 38 FROM THE NORTHEASTERN COAST FROM THE COMMUNITIES  OF VALENCA AREMBEPE AND PORTO SAUI-PE. IN THE INTERVIEWS WE USED  STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES AND SHOWED PHOTOS OF FISH SPECIES. OUR  RESULTS INDICATE SOME GENERAL PATTERNS IN FISHES' REPRODUCTION ACCORDING  TO FISHERMEN KNOWLEDGE FISH SPECIES SPAWN IN OPEN OCEAN NEAR REEFS OR  IN COASTAL RIVERS ESTUARIES SOME FISHES REPRODUCE DURING THE SUMMER  AND OTHERS IN WINTER WHILE SOME HAVE MORE DEFINED SPAWNING MONTHS. THE  MAIN FISH MIGRATORY PATTERNS MENTIONED BY INTERVIEWEES WERE LONG  MIGRATIONS ALONG THE COAST USUALLY IN THE SOUTH TO NORTH DIRECTION  SHORT MIGRATIONS AMONG REEFS FISHES THAT DO NOT MIGRATE MIGRATIONS  BETWEEN THE SHORE AND OPEN OCEAN AND MIGRATIONS BETWEEN THE SEA AND  COASTAL RIVERS. FISHERMEN'S KNOWLEDGE DIFFERED AMONG FISH SPECIES MOST  FISHERMEN DID NOT KNOW SPAWNING PLACES OR SEASONS OF LARGE PELAGIC  FISHES WHICH RAISED CONCERNS OF THEIR POSSIBLE DEPLETION.

THE MOST FREQUENTLY  USED FORAGING STRATEGY WAS ACTIVE CHASING' SUGGESTING A STRONG  PREFERENCE OF DOLPHINFISH IN USING VISUAL CUES DURING PREDATION. SMALLER  SIZE-CLASSES OF DOLPHINFISH DID NOT PERFORM THE SWIMMING IN CIRCLES' AND  SURF' STRATEGY PROBABLY DUE TO A LACK OF LEARNING EXPERIENCE SINCE  FURTHER SOCIAL INTERACTIONS COULD BE NEEDED IN ORDER TO SHOW THIS  STRATEGY.

INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE  SUBSEQUENTLY RECAPTURED SHOWED A MEAN MASS CHANGE OF 1.6 KG IN THE  INTERVAL BETWEEN TWO CONSECUTIVE POSTOVIPOSITIONS I.E. AFTER ONE  INTERNIDAL INTERVAL. WE PLOTTED THE MASS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AGAINST THE  CURVILINEAR CARAPACE LENGTH. AN ANALYSIS OF RESIDUAL MASS ABOVE AVERAGE  BODY CONDITION REVEALS THAT FEMALES WITH GOOD BODY CONDITION START  NESTING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON. PREOVIPOSITION MASS WAS MEASURED  WHEN THE FEMALE ABORTED THE NESTING PROCESS. GROSS MASS CHANGE WAS 5.46  KG. MEAN BODY MASS RECOVERY WAS 3.2 KG. BODY MASS RECOVERY WAS ALWAYS  SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE CHANGE IN GROSS MASS. THIS IS IN AGREEMENT  WITH THE OBSERVED MASS LOSS TENDENCY THROUGHOUT THE BREEDING SEASON FOR  THIS SPECIES. MASS RECOVERY WAS ANALYZED USING ALLOMETRIC LAW  CONVERTING BOTH LOSS IN BODY MASS AND TOTAL EGG MASS TO ENERGY. USING  MEAN TURTLE BODY MASS WE PERFORMED THREE SCENARIOS FOR THE METABOLIC  MAINTENANCE RATE OF THE HAWKSBILL TURTLE DURING THE NESTING PERIOD.

TO MANIPULATE HERBIVORY FIVE CORAL COLONIES WERE  CAGED FIVE LEFT UNCAGED AND PARTIAL CAGES WERE PLACED AROUND FIVE MORE  COLONIES TO TEST FOR A CAGE ARTIFACT. IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE COMPETITIVE  INTERACTION THREE TREATMENTS WERE APPLIED WITHIN EACH HERBIVORY PLOT.  CORAL-ALGAE CONTACT ZONES EITHER HAD ALGAE REMOVED CORAL TISSUE REMOVED  OR BOTH LEFT UNTOUCHED. DURING THE FIVE MONTH EXPERIMENT ALL 15  COLONIES BLEACHED BECAUSE OF NATURAL CAUSES AND CORAL TISSUE DID NOT  GROW IN ANY OF THE REPLICATES. CORAL MORTALITY WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY  AFFECTED BY ANY EXPERIMENTAL FACTOR. ON THE OTHER HAND ALGAL GROWTH WAS  NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY HERBIVOROUS FISHES MAINLY PARROT FISHES AND  DAMSELFISHES BUT DIRECT CONTACT WITH S. STELLATA TISSUE DID NOT HAVE  ANY EFFECT ON FILAMENTOUS ALGAE. CONSIDERING THAT S. STELLATA IS ONE OF  THE MOST COMMON CORALS IN TIDE POOLS AND REEF TOPS IN BRAZIL IT IS VERY  LIKELY THAT THE BLEACHING EVENT WEAKENED CORAL POLYPS AND FILAMENTOUS  ALGAE BECAME THE MAJOR COMPETITOR. IN CONCLUSION THE CORAL S. STELLATA  DID NOT OFFER ANY RESISTANCE TO ALGAE OVERGROWTH THAT WAS ONLY  CONTROLLED BY HERBIVORY.

THEY ARE MUCH RICHER IN PLATINUM-GROUP ELEMENTS  PGE THAN THE SURROUNDING SILICATE ROCKS AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT  CORRELATIONS AMONG ALL OF THE PGE AND BETWEEN PGE AND NI. HOWEVER THE  CORRELATIONS BETWEEN PGE AND AN CU AND S ARE MUCH WEAKER THAN  CORRELATIONS BETWEEN AN CU AND S.  IN THE MAGNETITE BODIES PALLADIUM-RICH MINERALS ESPECIALLY BISMUTHIDES  AND ANTIMONIDES ARE THE MOST ABUNDANT PLATINUM-GROUP MINERALS PGM. IN  MOST CASES THESE OCCUR WITH INTERSTITIAL SILICATES OR WITHIN SILICATE  INCLUSIONS IN MAGNETITE AND ILMENITE GRAINS AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH  CO-BEARING PENTLANDITE AND IN A FEW CASES WITH CO-NI SULFARSENIDES AND  ARSENIDES. SPERRYLITE PTAS2 IS THE MOST ABUNDANT PT MINERAL AND IS  ASSOCIATED WITH SILICATES INTERSTITIAL TO MAGNETITE AND ILMENITE GRAINS  AND SOMETIMES WITH CO-NI ARSENIDES. AT SITES WHERE THE IGNEOUS MAFIC  MINERALS HAVE BEEN ALTERED TO AMPHIHOLES SPERRYLITE MAY BE ALTERED TO  PT-FE ALLOYS. OTHER ALLOYS PRESENT INCLUDE PD-SN-CU PT-CU PT-NI AND  PT-AU.  IT IS SUGGESTED THAT NI AND PGE WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE MAGNETITE  BODIES BY THE COPRECIPITATION OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF SULFIDE WITH THE  MAGNETITE. THESE PGE-BEARING BASE METAL SULFIDES SUBSEQUENTLY EXSOLVED  PGM. THE ASSOCIATION OF PD MINERALS WITH BASE METAL SULFIDES AND THE  SMALL VARIATION IN THE PT/PD RATIO CA. 1.4 SUGGESTS THAT THE PGE HAVE  NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY REMOBILIZED IN THE MAGNETITITE IN CONTRAST THE  STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN S CU AND AN SUGGESTS THAT IN ADDITION TO  THE REDISTRIBUTION OF S IT IS LIKELY THAT CU AND AN WERE REMOBILIZED.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SAY WHETHER THE REDISTRIBUTION OF SULFUR WAS DUE  TO LATE MAGMATIC FLUIDS DISSOLVING S OR THE LATER METAMORPHIC EVENTS.  THE ASSOCIATION OF PGE ENRICHMENT WITH MAGNETITE LAYERS IN THE RIO  JACARE INTRUSION CONTRASTS WITH THAT OF THE BUSHVELD STILLWATER GREAT  DYKE AND MUNNI MUNNI COMPLEXES.

OUT OF A TOTAL OF 336 PROTECTED AREAS IDENTIFIED IN  BRAZILIAN COASTAL AND MARINE AREAS THE NORTH PLATFORM HAS THE LARGEST  PROTECTED AREA BUT THE ECOSYSTEM WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PROTECTED  AREA PREDOMINANTLY SUSTAINABLE AREAS WAS THE EAST COAST FOLLOWED BY  THE SOUTH PLATFORM. ONE OF THE REASONS THE EASTERN COAST OF BRAZIL TO  HAVE MORE PROTECTED AREAS IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS A LARGEST AMOUNT OF  CORAL REEFS. ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE  CREATION OF PROTECTED AREAS FOR SUSTAINABLE USE. THE COASTAL REGION OF  BRAZIL HAS ACHIEVED THE GOAL PROPOSED BY THE SEVENTH CONFERENCE OF THE  PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY 7 BUT ONLY THEN  THROUGH THE CATEGORY V OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF  NATURE WHICH IS NOT THE BEST EFFICIENT MEANS OF CONSERVING RESOURCES.  THE GOAL FOR MARINE CONSERVATION SHOWS ONLY THE AREA ABOVE THE  RECOMMENDED UNDER PROTECTION IN NORTH PLATFORM. THE MARINE PORTION OF  THE EAST COAST AND THE SOUTH PLATFORM HAS FEW PROTECTED AREAS  REGARDLESS OF CATEGORY MANAGEMENT. WE CONSIDER THE COASTAL REGION THE  RANGE OF 12 NAUTICAL MILES FROM BASELINES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA. AS FOR THE NUMBER  OF STRATEGIES PERMITTED BY LAW AND USED FOR THE CONSERVATION OF COASTAL  AND MARINE SYSTEMS COASTAL SYSTEMS SHOW A HIGHER NUMBER WHEN COMPARED  WITH THE MARINE SYSTEM. WE SUGGEST THAT THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD  SPECIFY STRATEGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF MARINE SYSTEMS AND EXPAND THE  PROTECTED AREAS OF ALL BARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEMS. C 2013 ELSEVIER LTD.

IN THE  PRESENT WORK UNDERWATER VISUAL CENSUSES OF FISHES WERE CONDUCTED AT  BOTH ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL REEFS AIMING AT VERIFYING WHETHER FISHES  ARE ATTRACTED OR AND PRODUCED ON ARTIFICIAL REEFS. LENGTH FREQUENCY  MEAN BIOMASS AND FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF FOUR FISH GENERA TARGETED BY  LOCAL FISHERIES CARANX HAEMULON LUTJANUS AND MYCTEROPERCA WERE  COMPARED BETWEEN TWO ARTIFICIAL AND TWO NATURAL REEFS. EVIDENCES OF BOTH  PRODUCTION AND ATTRACTION OF TARGET REEF FISHES BY ARTIFICIAL REEFS WERE  FOUND. PRODUCTION IS EVIDENCED BY THE ENORMOUS ABUNDANCE OF RECRUITS OF  A SINGLE GRUNT SPECIES THE TOMTATE HAEMULON AUROLINEATUM CUVIER. THE  HIGH CONCENTRATION OF ADULTS OF PREDATOR DEMERSAL FISHES MYCTEROPERCA  SPP. AND LUTJANUS SPP. PRESENT AT LOW DENSITY ON NATURAL REEFS IS THE  MAIN EVIDENCE FOR ATTRACTION BY ARTIFICIAL REEFS. RESULTS ARE  INCONCLUSIVE FOR THE PELAGIC PREDATORS CARANX SPP. THE ATTRACTION THAT  ARTIFICIAL REEFS EXERT OVER LARGE DEMERSAL PREDATORS CAN NEGATIVELY  AFFECT NEARBY NATURAL AREAS THROUGH SHIFTS IN PREDATION COMPETITION OR  NUTRIENT INPUT. PRODUCTION CAN AFFECT BENTHIC COMMUNITIES IN SOFT  BOTTOMS ADJACENT TO ARTIFICIAL REEFS BY FORAGING OF REEF-ASSOCIATED  FISHES. EVEN WHEN UNPLANNED FOR FISHERIES PURPOSES ARTIFICIAL REEFS ARE  OFTEN SUBMITTED TO COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHERIES AND DUE TO THE  STRONG ATTRACTION THEY EXERT OVER LARGE PREDATORS THESE STRUCTURES NEED  HARVEST REGULATIONS.

THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS THAT THESE  GENERA INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE AS AN ECOLOGICAL `PHASE SHIFT' RESPONSE TO  ECOLOGICAL DEGRADATION. HOWEVER SUCH STUDIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO A FEW  REGIONS INCLUDING THE GREATER CARIBBEAN BRAZIL AND JAPAN WITH LITTLE  WORK PERFORMED IN THE WATERS OF SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE CENTRAL  INDO-PACIFIC CIP. WE INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN ZOANTHARIAN COVER WITHIN  CORAL REEF BENTHIC COMMUNITIES AROUND TERENGGANU MALAYSIA BETWEEN JULY  2013 AND SEPTEMBER 2014 UTILIZING THE CORAL VIDEO TRANSECT METHOD TO  SURVEY THE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES OF NINE CORAL REEFS. ZOANTHARIAN  ABUNDANCE WAS OBSERVED TO BE INVERSELY PROPORTIONATE TO OTHER MAJOR  BENTHIC GROUPS ALGAE DEAD CORALS HARD CORALS. OVERALL ZOANTHARIANS  THRIVED IN REEFS WITH LOWER BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF REEF-BUILDING  CORALS. ADDITIONALLY AT ONE SITE PASIR AKAR WE DOCUMENTED A VERY  SUDDEN AND LARGE INCREASE OF ZOANTHARIAN COVER OVER TWO MONTHS FROM  MARCH TO MAY 2014. THIS INCREASE OCCURRED AFTER THE REEF WAS HEAVILY  DAMAGED DURING MONSOON SEASON. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT ZOANTHARIANS  ARE AN UNDERSTUDIED YET COMMON MAJOR COMPONENT OF REEFS IN SOUTHEAST  ASIA AND THAT LARGE CHANGES IN THEIR ABUNDANCE CAN OCCUR VERY RAPIDLY.  FURTHER RESEARCH INVESTIGATING LONGER-TERM TRENDS OF ZOANTHARIAN  ABUNDANCE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE CIP ARE NEEDED TO ASCERTAIN IF  DRAMATIC INCREASES ARE PART OF A `NORMAL' RECOVERY PROCESS OR REPRESENT  PHASE SHIFTS IN THE BENTHIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF CORAL REEFS.

Seismic profiles and jet-probe cores have shown a layer of calcareous sediments over 10 m thick that is formed mainly by the fragmentation of coralline algae. Video and scuba-diving observations demonstrate that dense aggregations of rhodoliths often change position on the sea bottom as a result of being dragged (""sail"" effect) by foliose algae such as Sargassum, Dictyopteris, and Zonaria. The benthic fauna associated with rhodoliths or foliose macroalgae (Hydrozoa and Amphipoda) is dominated by polychaetes, ophiuroids, and molluscs. The sessile fauna is poorly represented, consisting of some sponge species. It was possible to verify the following dynamics: (i) in summer, foliose macroalgae and zoobenthos (phytal) are established upon the rhodoliths; (ii) in early and midwinter, epiphytic macroalgae are senescent; (iii) in late winter, storms disturb sediments on the sea bottom, burying living rhodoliths and removing the foliose algae; and (iv) in spring, a bloom of the bivalvia Pinctata pectinata occurs, overgrowing the bottom. The rhodoliths tend to remain on the seafloor (with 10% to 20% estimated buried and becoming permanently incorporated to the sediment mass). The sediment dynamics are strongly dominated by erosive phases related to storms.",DE MACEDO DIAS GT 2012 J COAST RES,Coralline Algae Depositional Environments on the Brazilian Central–South-Eastern Shelf,10.2112/11t-00003.1,de Macedo Dias,Journal of Coastal Research,0.977011494252874,0.142857142857143

THAT IS WHY THESE  HUMAN GROUPS ARE USUALLY THE FIRST TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF POLICIES  CONCERNING FISHERIES AND OCEAN GOVERNANCE AND THE MOST AFFECTED BY THEM.  THESE POLICIES CAN POTENTIALLY BUILD OR ERODE SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL  RESILIENCE SER ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE COUPLED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL  CHANGES. SER ASSESSMENTS OFFER A VALUABLE TOOL TO IDENTIFY HUMAN-NATURE  LINKAGES AND THE IMPLICATIONS AND FEEDBACKS IN SESS WHEN FACING  HUMAN-INDUCED OR NATURAL CHANGES. WE CREATED A SER INDEX BY COMBINING  INTERVIEWS WITH FISHERS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DATASETS ON A FINE SCALE THAT  HAS NEVER BEEN PRESENTED FOR THE BRAZILIAN COAST. THIS SCALE WAS THEN  TESTED IN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS THAT ALLOW SUSTAINABLE USE. OUR  APPROACH ESTIMATED SER FROM INFORMATION ON FISHERIES ECOSYSTEM SERVICES  AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL SCALE CONSIDERING THE INDIVIDUAL AND  COMMUNITY LEVELS. WE SYNTHESIZED BLOCKS OF CRITICAL INDICATORS OF AN  INDIVIDUAL OR COMMUNITY'S ABILITY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN RESILIENCE IN  SESS SUCH AS FLEXIBILITY ABILITY TO LEARN ABILITY TO ORGANIZE  ASSETS SOCIAL CAPITAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS. WE IDENTIFIED  THAT FISHERS' ABILITY TO LEARN AND TO ORGANIZE AS WELL AS THE  BIOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY OF AN ECOSYSTEM ARE DETERMINANT TO ENHANCING SER  IN THE STUDIED COASTAL COMMUNITIES. A BAYESIAN MODEL ALSO SHOWED THAT  THE FISHERS' SER WAS RELATED TO SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS THEREBY  INDICATING THAT OLDER FISHERS FISHERS WHO CONSISTENTLY CATCH MORE FISH  AND FISHERS WITH A HIGHER RELIANCE ON FISHING FOR THEIR INCOME PRESENTED  LOWER INDEX VALUES. BY KNOWING THE VARIABLES THAT INFLUENCE THE ABILITY  OF FISHERS TO COPE WITH CHANGES TO THEIR SESS WE CAN DEVISE SMARTER  MANAGEMENT APPROACHES THAT MAY INCLUDE COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS FOR MORE  FRAGILE FISHERS. OUR FINDINGS CAN ALSO INFORM DECISION MAKING ABOUT  WHERE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE  PARTICIPATIVE AND EFFECTIVE IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE SOCIAL IMPACTS OF  POLICY DECISIONS AND INCREASE SER IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES.,SILVA MR 2020 ECOL SOC,A social-ecological approach to estimate fisher resilience: a case study from Brazil,10.5751/es-11361-250123,Silva,Ecology and Society,0.976190476190476,1

Multi-view filters were applied and tested for speckle noise reduction. A digital unsupervised classification based on image segmentation was performed and the classification accuracy was evaluated by an error matrix built between the SAR image classification and a reference map obtained from a TM Landsat-5 classification. The adaptative filters showed the best results for speckle suppression and border preservation, especially the Kuan, Gamma MAP, Lee, Frost and Enhanced Frost filters. Small similarity and area thresholds (5 and 10, respectively) were used for the image segmentation due to the reduced dimensions and the narrow and elongated forms of the reefs. The classification threshold of 99% had a better user's accuracy, but a lower producer's accuracy because it is a more restrictive threshold; therefore, it may be possible that it had a greater omission on reef classification. The results indicate that SAR images have a good potential for the detection of emergent coral reefs.",RUDORFF FM 2008 BRAZ J OCEANOGR,"Coral reef detection using SAR/RADARSAT-1 images at Costa dos Corais, PE/AL, Brazil",10.1590/s1679-87592008000200002,Rudorff,Brazilian Journal of Oceanography,0.975903614457831,1

THE ORIGIN OF THE LARGEST PART OF  THIS SOLID WASTE WAS THE LOCAL RIVERS. THESE RIVERS DRAIN MANY  MUNICIPALITIES BUT HAVE THEIR MOUTHS NEXT TO TAMANDARE. BEACH USERS AND  LOCALS WERE EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCUMULATED RESIDUE. FROM AUGUST  2001 THE MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION STARTED A BEACH CLEANING SERVICE  AIMING TO MINIMIZE THE NEGATIVE AESTHETIC EFFECTS CAUSED BY THE  ACCUMULATION OF SOLID WASTES. SAMPLING OF PLASTIC ITEMS ACCUMULATED ON  THE BEACH WITHIN FOUR TRANSECTS OF 2500 SQUARE METERS EACH WAS CARRIED  OUT FOR 4 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLEANING SERVICE BEGAN AND RESULTED IN A  TOTAL OF 9289 PLASTIC ITEMS. THE DRY AND RAINY SEASON ACCUMULATIONS WERE  SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. AFTER THE START OF THE SERVICE IN THE SAME  SAMPLING AREA PLASTIC ITEMS WERE 1712 IN TOTAL. IN THIS CASE THE  SEASONS WERE NO LONGER SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. THERE WERE AESTHETIC  SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM THE CLEANING SERVICES.  HOWEVER THOSE WERE JUST A PALLIATIVE AND INEFFICIENT TO DEFINITELY  SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

THIS WORK  INVESTIGATES CONTRASTING DEPOSITIONAL AND GEOMORPHOLOGICAL PATTERNS IN  THE ABROLHOS SHELF-SLOPE SYSTEM EASTERN BRAZILIAN MARGIN SOUTH  ATLANTIC. WE HAVE COMBINED EXISTING BATHYMETRIC DATASETS WITH BOTTOM  IMAGERY AND SAMPLES COLLECTED AT THE JOHNSON-SEA-LINK MANNED SUBMERSIBLE  ALONG TWO ABROLHOS SLOPE SITES WHICH ARE SEPARATED BY ALMOST 2 DEGREES  OF LATITUDE. OUR DATASET INCLUDES SEAFLOOR SEDIMENTS SINGLE-BEAM  ECHOSOUNDER AND 20H OF VIDEO RECORDING. DIVES RANGED FROM 90 TO 620M  WATER DEPTH. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NORTH AND SOUTH ABROLHOS  SHELF-SLOPE SYSTEMS ARE DISTINCT IN TERMS OF THEIR MORPHOLOGY AND  SEDIMENTOLOGY. THE DEPOSITIONAL PATTERN IN THE NORTHERN UPPER SLOPE IS  TYPICALLY CARBONATE DOMINATED WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF CARBONATE MOUNDS  AROUND 500M DEEP SMALL BIOGENIC STRUCTURES AROUND 200M DEEP  INTERSPERSED WITH WACKSTONES AND PACKSTONES. THE UPPER SLOPE IS  CHARACTERIZED BY A STEEP LIMESTONE WALL AT 120M DEEP THAT RESEMBLES A  SHELF-EDGE REEF FOLLOWED BY EXTENSIVE RHODOLITH BEDS AT THE SHELF EDGE  AND OUTER SHELF. THE SOUTHERN UPPER SLOPE SHOWS A SIGMOIDAL PROFILE WITH  A GENTLE GRADIENT. MIXED SILICICLASTIC-CARBONATE FINE SEDIMENTATION  DOMINATES FROM 300 TO 700M DEEP. ON THE UPPER SLOPE FINE CARBONATE  SEDIMENTATION PREDOMINATES AND A BIOGENIC REEF STRUCTURE IS OBSERVED IN  A WATER DEPTH AROUND 120-130M. THE SHELF EDGE AND OUTER SHELF ARE ALSO  CHARACTERIZED BY EXTENSIVE RHODOLITH BEDS. MAIN FINDINGS INDICATE THAT A  VOLCANIC ROCK COMPLEX IS AN IMPORTANT ANTECEDENT GEOLOGY THAT MAY  INFLUENCE THE SETTING UP OF DISTINCT SEDIMENTARY REGIMES AND SEDIMENT  INPUT TO THE SLOPE. THE GEOMETRY OF THE ANTECEDENT GEOLOGY CONTROLS THE  PALEOTOPOGRAPHY FORMING A GRADIENT TOWARDS THE SOUTH.

WE EXPLORED LARGE-SCALE VARIATION IN REEF FISH  TROPHIC INTERACTIONS ENCOMPASSING TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL REEFS WITH  DIFFERENT ABIOTIC CONDITIONS AND TROPHIC STRUCTURE OF REEF FISH  COMMUNITY. REEF FISH FEEDING PRESSURE ON THE BENTHOS WAS DETERMINED  COMBINING BITE RATES ON THE SUBSTRATE AND THE INDIVIDUAL BIOMASS PER  UNIT OF TIME AND AREA USING VIDEO RECORDINGS IN THREE SITES BETWEEN  LATITUDES 17 DEGREES S AND 27 DEGREES S ON THE BRAZILIAN COAST. TOTAL  FEEDING PRESSURE DECREASED 10-FOLD AND THE COMPOSITION OF FUNCTIONAL  GROUPS AND SPECIES SHIFTED FROM THE NORTHERN TO THE SOUTHERNMOST SITES.  BOTH PATTERNS WERE DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN THE FEEDING PRESSURE OF  ROVING HERBIVORES PARTICULARLY SCRAPERS WHILE THE FEEDING PRESSURE OF  INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS AND OMNIVORES REMAINED SIMILAR. THE DIFFERENTIAL  CONTRIBUTION TO THE FEEDING PRESSURE ACROSS TROPHIC CATEGORIES WITH  ROVING HERBIVORES BEING MORE IMPORTANT IN THE NORTHERNMOST AND  SOUTHEASTERN REEFS DETERMINED CHANGES IN THE INTENSITY AND COMPOSITION  OF FISH FEEDING PRESSURE ON THE BENTHOS AMONG SITES.

Located 230 km off the NE Brazilian coast, Rocas is formed by coralline red algae and vermetid mollusks, and is potentially one of the most ""pristine"" areas in Southwestern Atlantic. We provide the first comprehensive and integrative description of the fish and benthic communities inhabiting different shallow reef habitats of Rocas. We studied two contrasting tide pool habitats: open pools, which communicate with the open ocean even during low tides, thus more exposed to wave action; and closed pools, which remain isolated during low tide and are comparatively less exposed. Reef fish assemblages, benthic cover, algal turfs and fish feeding pressure on the benthos remarkably varied between open and closed pools. The planktivore Thalassoma noronhanum was the most abundant fish species in both habitats. In terms of biomass, the lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris and the omnivore Melichtys niger were dominant in open pools, while herbivorous fishes (mainly Acanthurus spp.) prevailed in closed pools. Overall benthic cover was dominated by algal turfs, composed of articulated calcareous algae in open pools and non-calcified algae in closed pools. Feeding pressure was dominated by acanthurids and was 10-fold lower in open pools than in closed pools. Besides different wave exposure conditions, such pattern could also be related to the presence of sharks in open pools, prompting herbivorous fish to feed more in closed pools. This might indirectly affect the structure of reef fish assemblages and benthic communities. The macroalgae Digenea simplex, which is uncommon in closed pools and abundant in the reef flat, was highly preferred in herbivory assays, indicating that herbivory by fishes might be shaping this distribution pattern. The variations in benthic and reef fish communities, and feeding pressure on the benthos between open and closed pools suggest that the dynamics in open pools is mostly driven by physical factors and the tolerance of organisms to harsh conditions, while in closed pools direct and indirect effects of species interactions also play an important role. Understanding the mechanisms shaping biological communities and how they scale-up to ecosystem functioning is particularly important on isolated near-pristine systems where natural processes can still be studied under limited human impact.",LONGO GO 2015 PLOS ONE,"Between-Habitat Variation of Benthic Cover, Reef Fish Assemblage and Feeding Pressure on the Benthos at the Only Atoll in South Atlantic: Rocas Atoll, NE Brazil",10.1371/journal.pone.0127176,Longo,PLOS ONE,0.975,1

LOCATION SIX BRAZILIAN TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL CORAL AND ROCKY COASTAL  REEFS AND THE OCEANIC ISLAND OF ATOL DAS ROCAS BETWEEN LATITUDES  0DEGREES AND 27DEGREES S.  METHODS UNDERWATER VISUAL CENSUS DATA COLLECTED BY THE AUTHORS FIVE  LOCATIONS OR OBTAINED FROM THE LITERATURE TWO LOCATIONS WERE USED TO  ESTIMATE THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF 123 FISH SPECIES BELONGING TO 33  REEF-ASSOCIATED FAMILIES. CRYPTIC SPECIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE  ANALYSIS. FISHES WERE GROUPED IN EIGHT TROPHIC CATEGORIES ROVING  HERBIVORES TERRITORIAL HERBIVORES MOBILE INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS SESSILE  INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS OMNIVORES PLANKTIVORES PISCIVORES AND  CARNIVORES. AFTER A SERIES OF DETAILED PREDICTIONS BASED ON PHYLOGENY  PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS AND ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS WAS ESTABLISHED THE  COMMUNITY TROPHIC STRUCTURE WAS ANALYSED ALONG A LATITUDINAL GRADIENT  AND AMONG COASTAL MID-SHORE AND OCEANIC SITES.  RESULTS THE TROPHIC STRUCTURE OF BRAZILIAN REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES CLEARLY  CHANGED WITH LATITUDE. ROVING HERBIVORES SUCH AS SCARIDS AND ACANTHURIDS  WERE PROPORTIONALLY MORE ABUNDANT AT LOW LATITUDES. THE BROWSING  HERBIVORES KYPHOSIDS FOLLOWED AN OPPOSITE LATITUDINAL PATTERN. THE  PARROTFISH GENUS SPARISOMA MORE PLASTIC IN ITS FEEDING HABITS THAN  SCARUS PRESENTED WIDER DISTRIBUTION. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF  TERRITORIAL HERBIVORES DID NOT DECREASE TOWARDS HIGHER LATITUDES. MOBILE  INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN LOW LATITUDES OR THE  SECOND MOST IMPORTANT TROPHIC GUILD IN HIGH LATITUDES AT ALL COASTAL  SITES. SESSILE INVERTEBRATE FEEDERS DID NOT SHOW ANY CLEAR LATITUDINAL  TREND DESPITE AN EXPECTED INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE TOWARDS LOW LATITUDES.  OMNIVORES DOMINATED HIGH LATITUDE REEFS 27DEGREES S AND PLANKTIVORES  THE OCEANIC ISLAND ATOL DAS ROCAS. PISCIVORES AND CARNIVORES WERE  PROPORTIONALLY BETTER REPRESENTED IN HIGH LATITUDES.  MAIN CONCLUSIONS LATITUDINAL PATTERNS SEEM TO BE INFLUENCED BY  PHYLOGENY PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS MAINLY RELATED TO TEMPERATURE  AND ALSO BY ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS. GRAZING SCARIDS AND ACANTHURIDS ARE  LARGELY RESTRICTED TO TROPICAL REEFS AND SHOW AN ABRUPT DECLINE BEYOND  23DEGREES S. THIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE AMOUNT OF ALGAE PRESENT BUT  PROBABLY TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS. OTHER  HERBIVORES SEEM TO OVERCOME THIS THROUGH SYMBIOTIC MICROBIAL DIGESTIVE  PROCESSES KYPHOSIDS MANIPULATING THE STRUCTURE OF ALGAL TURFS OR  INCREASING ANIMAL PROTEIN FROM WITHIN THE TERRITORY POMACENTRIDS.  OMNIVORES DOMINATE THE SOUTHERN SITES ARRAIAL DO CABO AND ARVOREDO  BEING MORE ADAPTED TO ENVIRONMENT CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO SEASONAL AND/OR  STOCHASTIC SHIFTS. LARGE CARNIVORES INCLUDING PISCIVORES EXTEND  FARTHER INTO HIGH-LATITUDE HABITATS APPARENTLY NOT CONSTRAINED BY  THERMAL THRESHOLDS THAT LIMIT THE HERBIVORES. OVERFISHING AND/OR  ORNAMENTAL HARVESTING CERTAINLY HAS BEEN MODIFYING LOCAL FISH  COMMUNITIES BUT COULD NOT BE DETECTED PROPERLY AT THE LARGE-SCALE  PATTERNS FOUND IN THIS STUDY.

HOWEVER LOCAL ANTHROPOGENIC THREATS ARE THE MOST SERIOUS AND  LASTING CAUSES FOR THE DEVASTATION OF CORAL REEFS. THE ECOLOGICAL  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIOMES AND ANTHROMES PROVIDE US AN INTERESTING  FIELD OF CURRENT STUDIES. IN GUARAJUBA BEACH AT THE NORTHERN COAST OF  BAHIA THERE IS A REEFS COMPLEX WHICH HAS BEEN STUDIED SINCE THE 80S.

CONSISTENTLY NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LATITUDE AND POSITIVE  RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE SST AND RELATIVE  RICHNESS AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF HERBIVOROUS FISHES WERE FOUND  WORLDWIDE. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE STRENGTH OF GRADIENTS OF  RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WITH LATITUDE AND SST BETWEEN TROPICAL AND  EXTRATROPICAL ZONES WERE FOUND CONSISTENTLY ACROSS OCEAN BASINS.  STANDARDIZED SAMPLING ALONG THE WESTERN ATLANTIC ALSO SHOWED NEGATIVE  RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LATITUDE AND TOTAL DENSITY AND BIOMASS.

OCTOPODS IN ALL MATURITY STAGES WERE OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE  YEAR HOWEVER MATURE FEMALES WERE SCARCE SUGGESTING THAT THEY MIGHT  MIGRATE TO SPAWN IN DEEPER WATERS. BASED ON THIS STUDY IT IS RECOMMENDED  THAT A MINIMUM ALLOWED CATCH SIZE MEASURE OF AROUND 500 G IS IMPLEMENTED  IN THE FISHERY IN ORDER TO AVOID CATCHING BOTH SMALL MATURE MALES AND  MATURING FEMALES AND THAT OCTOPUS FISHING IS RESTRICTED TO DEPTHS OF UP  TO 15 M TO AVOID FISHING MATURE SPAWNING FEMALES.

VARIATIONS IN SUBAERIAL BEACH MORPHOLOGY  ALONG 39 CROSS-SHORE PROFILES AT PONTAL DO CUPE BEACH NORTHEASTERN  BRAZIL WERE ANALYSED USING MODELLED WAVE DATA AND MONTHLY BEACH  TOPOGRAPHY ACQUIRED FROM NOVEMBER 2014 TO SEPTEMBER 2016. PONTAL DO CUPE  HAS A REEF TO THE SOUTH BUT IS EXPOSED TO WAVES IN THE NORTH MAKING  THIS AN IDEAL LOCATION TO ASSESS THE SHELTERING EFFECT OF THE REEF.  BEACH VOLUME AND BEACH WIDTH DATA WERE USED TO COMPARE THE REEF-FRONTED  PROFILES WITH THOSE OF THE EXPOSED ADJACENT BEACH. SEVEN GROUPS OF  PROFILES WERE IDENTIFIED BY APPLYING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS TO THE  TOPOGRAPHY DATASET. A SIMPLE NUMERICAL MODEL WAS USED TO QUANTIFY THE  ROLE OF THE REEF IN DISSIPATING WAVE ENERGY SHOWING A REDUCTION OF  APPROXIMATELY 50\% IN INCOMING WAVE ENERGY TO THE SHORE. THE  REEF-FRONTED BEACH IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE STABLE THAN THE EXPOSED BEACH.  TOTAL BEACH VOLUME IS SIMILAR FOR BOTH THE EXPOSED AND THE REEF-FRONTED  BEACH.

NEVERTHELESS A  NUMBER OF RECORDS HOLD UP TO CRITICAL EVALUATION. EARLY ATTEMPTS TO  RECONSTRUCT THE LGM TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION CONDITIONS FOR THE  LGM AROUND 21 C-14 KA BP HAVE SUGGESTED THAT RELATIVE TO PRESENT  LOWLAND TEMPERATURES WERE ON AVERAGE ONLY A FEW DEGREES C COOLER  WHEREAS IN THE ANDES THE TEMPERATURE DEPRESSION WAS IN THE RANGE OF 6-8  DEGREES C. THESE RECONSTRUCTIONS FURTHER SUGGESTED THAT TROPICAL  PRECIPITATION WAS MORE LIMITED IN BOTH THE LOWLANDS AND IN THE ANDES.  ALTHOUGH RECENT POLLEN EVIDENCE SUPPORTS SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER TROPICAL  LOWLAND TEMPERATURES DURING THE LGM ADDITIONAL ALKENONE EVIDENCE FROM  SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND MODEL ANALYSIS ARE CONTRADICTORY. THE DATA  FROM TROPICAL SOUTH AMERICA SUGGEST THAT THE LATE QUATERNARY CLIMATIC  CHANGES OF THE LOWLANDS AS WELL AS OF THE ANDEAN MOUNTAINS REFLECT A  RESPONSE 1 TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN THE SOURCE AREA OF THE MOISTURE  AND 2 TO GLOBAL TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS. BASED ON GLACIAL  PERIGLACIAL AND POLLEN EVIDENCE A LGM TEMPERATURE DEPRESSION OF 5-6  DEGREES C CAN BE ASSUMED FOR BOTH TROPICAL LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA AND THE  ANDES. THESE LGM VALUES FOR THE COOLING CORRESPOND WITH RECENT CORAL  RECORDS FROM BARBADOS AND THE SOUTHWESTERN PACIFIC ICE-CORE RECORDS  FROM PERU NOBLE-GAS MEASUREMENTS IN BRAZIL AND OCEAN CORE RECORDS FROM  THE WESTERN EQUATORIAL ATLANTIC.

THE ABROLHOS  SHELF SHOWS TWO DISTINCT SECTORS THE NORTHERN AREA IS A TYPICAL MIXED  SEDIMENT ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS A SUPPLY REGIME ALONG THE COAST/SHOREFACE  MAINLY DUE TO LONGSHORE TRANSPORT AND A CARBONATE REGIME ALONG THE INNER  AND OUTER SHELF. THE SOUTHERN SHELF MORPHOLOGY AND SEDIMENTATION ARE  CONTROLLED BY THE ANTECEDENT TOPOGRAPHY AND IS TYPICALLY A ACCOMMODATION  REGIME SHELF WITH ASSOCIATED RHODOLITH BEDS. THE DOCE RIVER SHELF IS A  SUPPLY REGIME ENVIRONMENT WITH THE FORMATION OF A 5-8 M THICK REGRESSIVE  DEPOSIT WITH DOWNLAPPING DINOFORMS. SOUTHWARD FROM THE DOCE RIVER SHELF  A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN SEDIMENTARY REGIME IS OBSERVED AS THE MORPHOLOGY  BECOMES VERY IRREGULAR WITH ASSOCIATED HARDBOTTOMS AND UNFILLED  PALEOVALLEYS. THIS SECTOR OF THE SHELF PALEOVALLEY SHELF IS  CHARACTERIZED BY AN ACCOMMODATION REGIME. THE INTERPRETATION SHOWS THAT  THE ENTIRE STUDY AREA CAN BE DEFINED AS A MIXED SEDIMENTATION SHELF  SHOWING SUPPLY AND ACCOMMODATION REGIMES. SHELF MORPHOLOGY WORKED AS AN  INDICATOR OF THESE CHANGES. CARBONATE/TERRIGENOUS DEPOSITION DURING A  HIGHSTAND/REGRESSIVE PHASE COEVAL ALONG THE EASTERN BRAZILIAN SHELF  EITHER LATERALLY AND ACROSS SHELF. THIS LATERAL/ALONG COAST VARIATION IN  SEDIMENT SUPPLY AND CARBONATE PRODUCTION LEADS TO DISTINCT LATERAL  FACIES AND GEOMETRY. THESE SPATIAL CHANGES IN MORPHOLOGY AND FADES WITH  COEXISTENCE OF CARBONATE AND SILICICLASTIC SEDIMENTATION ARE VERY  IMPORTANT FOR THE CORRELATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL  RECORD ESPECIALLY STRATIGRAPHIC SURFACES AND SEQUENCE UNITS.

NET CALCIFICATION RATIO WAS  SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN HYDROCORALS EXPOSED TO INTERMEDIATE SEAWATER  ACIDIFICATION FOR 16 D AND TO SEVERE SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION FOR 16 D OR  30 D COMPARED TO ANIMALS AT CONTROL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER ONLY  HYDROCORALS EXPOSED TO SEVERE SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION SHOWED LOWER NET  CALCIFICATION RATES THAN THOSE EXPOSED TO CONTROL CONDITIONS FOR 30 D.  IN ACCORDANCE THE ACTIVITIES OF ENZYMES INVOLVED IN THE CALCIFICATION  PROCESS MARKEDLY INCREASED IN HYDROCORALS EXPOSED TO REDUCED PH.  CA-ATPASE SEEMED TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION THAN  CARBONIC ANHYDRASE AS IT INCREASED IN HYDROCORALS EXPOSED TO  INTERMEDIATE AND SEVERE SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION FOR 30 D WHILE CARBONIC  ANHYDRASE ACTIVITY WAS ONLY STIMULATED UNDER SEVERE SEAWATER  ACIDIFICATION. THEREFORE OUR FINDINGS CLEARLY SHOW THAT THE HYDROCORAL  M. ALCICORNIS IS ABLE TO COPE TO SOME EXTENT WITH LONG-TERM CO2-DRIVEN  ACIDIFICATION OF SEAWATER PH AE<YEN> 7.5. IN ADDITION THEY SHOW THAT  CA-ATPASE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF CALCIFICATION RATE  UNDER SCENARIOS OF MODERATE AND INTERMEDIATE LEVELS OF SEAWATER  ACIDIFICATION. HOWEVER THE OBSERVED INCREASE IN CA-ATPASE AND CARBONIC  ANHYDRASE ACTIVITY WAS NOT ENOUGH TO COMPENSATE FOR THE EFFECTS OF  CO2-DRIVEN REDUCTION IN SEAWATER PH ON THE NET CALCIFICATION RATE OF THE  HYDROCORAL M.

TOGETHER WITH THE FA1 INDEX THE NUMBER OF GILL RAKERS AND THE NUMBER OF  RAYS OF THE PECTORAL FIN PROVIDED THE BEST METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO  ADDRESS THE LEVELS OF FA IN O.

934,LEAO 2003 LATIN AMERICAN CORAL REEFS,2003,Corals and coral reefs of Brazil ,,"The Brazilian coral reefs form structures significantly different from the well known coral reef models, because (i) they have a characteristic initial growth form of mushroom-shaped coral pinnacles called ""chapeiro?es"", (ii) they are build by a very low diversity coral fauna, rich in endemic species, which are relic forms, remnant of an ancient coral fauna dating back in the Tertiary, (iii) incrusting coralline algae have an important role in the construction of the reef structure, and (iv) the nearshore bank reefs are surrounded and even filled with muddy siliciclastic sediments. The isolated reefs columns, the ""chapeiro?es"", fuse together at their tops, forming large compound reef structures of varied sizes, with horizontal tops, and somewhat irregular shape. They can be completely exposed during low tides. These reef structures are distributed into three major sectors along the tropical coast of Brazil: the northern, the northeastern and the eastern coasts. There are different types of bank reefs, fringing reefs and an atoll. Corals, milleporids and coralline algae build the rigid frame of the reefs. The coral fauna, so far identified, comprises less than eighteen species, being some of them endemic to the Brazilian waters. Quaternary sea-level fluctuations affected the growth of the reefs in Brazil; transgressive and regressive seas marked different stages of reef development. The areas where the major coral reefs occur correspond to regions where nearby urban centres are experiencing accelerated growth and tourist development is increasing very fast. The major human impacts to the reef ecosystem are mostly associated with agricultural activities (sugarcane and timber), mineral and chemical industries and oil exploration. Increased sedimentation due to removal of the Atlantic rainforest and the disposal of industrial and urban effluents, are additional stresses to the coastal marine environment in Brazil. There are not many institutions concerned with preservation of the Brazilian coral reefs, and they are also fairly new.

Its variability in movements across habitat types suggests the possibility of a complex genetic population structure. Here, we use mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to investigate the genetic connectivity of the Caribbean reef shark across contemporary and evolutionary time-scales and relate our findings to the ecology of this understudied species. Samples were obtained from 216 individuals from six western Atlantic and Caribbean locations. Individuals were genotyped at seven nuclear microsatellite DNA loci and sequenced at two mitochondrial (control region [CR ]; NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 [ND 4]) and one nuclear locus (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH ]). Analyses to resolve the population genetic structure and evolutionary history of this species were adopted. Findings of genetic differentiation are concordant with previous movement studies showing residency and/or site-fidelity to specific locations by individuals. However, similar to other reef shark studies, we found that the level of genetic connectivity among populations was context dependent-i.e., sharks occupying isolated habitats showed greater genetic differentiation compared with those sharks occupying semi-isolated or continuous reef habitats. Furthermore, low genetic diversity and a shallow mitochondrial population history were found, suggesting historical demographic fluctuations, including population collapse and more recent expansions.",BERNARD AM 2017 J BIOGEOGR,"Genetic connectivity of a coral reef ecosystem predator: the population genetic structure and evolutionary history of the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi

Cu effects on biomarkers associated with photosynthesis, oxidative status and calcification were evaluated in the Brazilian coral Mussismilia harttii using a marine mesocosm facility. Polyps were kept under control conditions (1.9 ?g L?1 Cu) or exposed to dissolved Cu (3.0, 4.8, and 6.7 ?g L?1) for 12 days. Photochemical efficiency of the photosystem II of symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) was measured and polyps were analyzed for antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and carbonic anhydrase Ca-ATPase, Mg-ATPase and (Ca,Mg)-ATPase activities after 12 days. Results highlighted the effects of Cu exposure, leading corals to an oxidative stress condition [increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and DNA damage] and a possible reduced calcification ability [decreased (Ca,Mg)-ATPase activity]. Therefore, biomarkers associated with oxidative status (TAC and DNA damage) and calcification [(Ca, Mg)-ATPase] are indicated as good predictors of corals health.",DE BARROS MARANGONI LF 2017 MAR ENVIRON RES,"Copper effects on biomarkers associated with photosynthesis, oxidative status and calcification in the Brazilian coral Mussismilia harttii (Scleractinia, Mussidae)",10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.08.002,Marangoni,Marine Environmental Research,0.969325153374233,0

ASCIDIANS ONE OF THE DOMINANT  TAXONOMIC GROUPS IN SUBTIDAL SESSILE COMMUNITIES HAVE SPECIALIZED  MORULA CELLS THAT PROVIDE A DEFENSE AGAINST MICROBIAL INFECTIONS.  INJURIES RESULTING FROM INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS MIGHT  ALSO ACT AS A STIMULUS FOR THIS DEFENSIVE MECHANISM. THEREFORE WE  EXPECTED TO SEE THE RECRUITMENT OF MORULA CELLS IN TISSUES NEAR  COMPETITOR CONTACT ZONES. TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SPATIAL  COMPETITION ELICITS THIS IMMUNE RESPONSE WE PLACED COLONIES OF THE  ASCIDIAN DIDEMNUM PERLUCIDUM FROM SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL IN FOUR DIFFERENT  TYPES OF COMPETITIVE SITUATIONS 1 OVERGROWTH OF THE COMPETITOR 2  STAND-OFF INTERACTIONS 3 OVERGROWTH BY THE COMPETITOR AND 4 FREE  OF COMPETITORS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS  INCREASE THE POPULATION OF MORULA CELLS IN CONTACT ZONES AS MORE CELLS  WERE OBSERVED IN INTERACTIONS THAT RESULTED IN THE OVERGROWTH OF  INDIVIDUALS OF D.

DESPITE THESE CONSISTENT PATTERNS  FEEDING RATES FOOD SELECTION AND FREQUENCY OF AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS  DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN SITES FOR MOST SPECIES.

The possible benefits of protection from fishing were particularly evaluated by comparing sites with varying levels of protection. Two reefs within the well-enforced no-take area of the National Marine Park of Abrolhos (Parcel dos Abrolhos and California) were compared with two unprotected coastal reefs (Sebasti�o Gomes and Pedra de Leste) and one legally protected but poorly enforced coastal reef (the ""paper park"" of Timbebas Reef). The fish biomass was lower and the fleshy macroalgal cover was higher in the unprotected reefs compared with the protected areas. The unprotected and protected reefs had similar seawater chemistry. Lower vibrio CFU counts were observed in the fully protected area of California Reef. Metagenome analysis showed that the unprotected reefs had a higher abundance of archaeal and viral sequences and more bacterial pathogens, while the protected reefs had a higher abundance of genes related to photosynthesis. Similar to other reef systems in the world, there was evidence that reductions in the biomass of herbivorous fishes and the consequent increase in macroalgal cover in the Abrolhos Bank may be affecting microbial diversity and abundance. Through the integration of different types of ecological data, the present study showed that protection from fishing may lead to greater reef health. The data presented herein suggest that protected coral reefs have higher microbial diversity, with the most degraded reef (Sebasti�o Gomes) showing a marked reduction in microbial species richness. It is concluded that ecological conditions in unprotected reefs may promote the growth and rapid evolution of opportunistic microbial pathogens.",BRUCE T 2012 PLOS ONE,"Abrolhos Bank Reef Health Evaluated by Means of Water Quality, Microbial Diversity, Benthic Cover, and Fish Biomass Data",10.1371/journal.pone.0036687,Bruce,PLoS ONE,0.966666666666667,1

This area has attracted the attention of biologists because of its peculiar mushroom-shaped structures, locally known as ""chapeir�es"", and endemic species of corals and other organisms. The macrophytobenthos compartment plays an important ecological role in the functioning of the bank, and some reports on the presence of seaweeds and seagrasses have been published; however, the data are fragmentary, and a more detailed survey of the macrophytobenthos compartment is lacking. Here we consolidate the information available and add new data obtained from two expeditions focused on seaweed and seagrass diversity from two sectors of the bank: the islands of the Abrolhos archipelago (AA) and the Sebasti�o Gomes Reef (SG). These sites were selected for their contrasting characteristics. Specifically, SG (15 km off the mouth of the Caravelas River) is subjected to a broader range of anthropogenic impacts and to input of terrigenous sediments, while the AA (54 km offshore) is surrounded by calcareous biogenic sediments, has clearer water and is less affected by human activities. Macrophytobenthic species richness on both reference areas is larger than previously thought. Considering previous records, there are 164 species of macrophytes in AA and 111 species in SG, of which 59 and 74 species are first records for each respective location. The higher species richness at the AA may result from a higher habitat complexity and lower turbidity, but a potential negative effect of enhanced human impacts at SG cannot be ruled out. Considering that macroalgae are relevant components of the benthic community, as producers and structurer organisms, the data presented herein provide a reliable baseline for future environmental studies, and thus may contribute to improve management policies within the unique ecosystem of Abrolhos.",TORRANO-SILVA BN 2013 CONT SHELF RES,"Macrophytobenthic flora of the Abrolhos Archipelago and the Sebastião Gomes Reef, Brazil",10.1016/j.csr.2013.09.019,Torrano-Silva,Continental Shelf Research,0.965909090909091,1

Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia 41 (1889) 102] has a widespread distribution over the Western Atlantic, where it has been reported from Bermuda and Bahamas to southern Brazil. Nonetheless, reproductive features of this species, which broods asexually produced offspring, suggest that it has low dispersal capabilities. This raises a question about the specific status of the Brazilian population of A. bermudensis. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the taxonomic status of the Brazilian population, by genetically comparing it with the type locality (Bermuda) population. For this, we used allozyme electrophoresis to analyze samples from both populations. Thirteen enzyme systems (16 loci) yielded interpretable results for all populations. A high differentiation was encountered for the Western Atlantic A. bermudensis population (FST=0.434), partially due to the presence of a diagnostic locus (LAP) between Bermuda and Brazilian populations. This result could be taken as an indication that the Brazilian population should be elevated to a specific status. We do expect some genetic differentiation, however, between natural populations separated over wide geographic distances. Finally, since Mantel and regression analyses did not rule out the isolation by distance model, we have conservatively decided to maintain the specific status of A. bermudensis from Brazil.",VIANNA P 2003 J EXP MAR BIOL ECOL,"Genetic divergence and isolation by distance in the West Atlantic sea anemone Actinia bermudensis (McMurrich, 1889)",10.1016/s0022-0981(03)00340-x,Vianna,Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,0.965217391304348,1

CHROMITITE LAYERS IN THE LUANGA COMPLEX OCCUR IN  THE UPPER PORTION OF INTERLAYERED HARZBURGITE AND ORTHOPYROXENITE OF THE  TRANSITION ZONE AND ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOWERMOST NORITES OF THE MAFIC  ZONE. THE STRATIGRAPHIC INTERVAL THAT HOSTS CHROMITITES SIMILAR TO 150  METERS THICK CONSISTS OF SEVERAL CYCLIC UNITS INTERPRETED AS THE RESULT  OF SUCCESSIVE INFLUXES OF PRIMITIVE PARENTAL MAGMA. THE COMPOSITIONS OF  CHROMITE IN CHROMITITES FROM THE TRANSITION ZONE LOWER GROUP  CHROMITITES HAVE DISTINCTIVELY HIGHER CR\# 100CR/CR + AL + FE3+  COMPARED WITH CHROMITE IN CHROMITITES FROM THE MAFIC ZONE UPPER GROUP  CHROMITITES. CHROMITITES HOSTED BY NORITIC ROCKS ARE PRECEDED BY A THIN  LAYER OF HARZBURGITE LOCATED 15-20 CM BELOW EACH CHROMITITE LAYER. LOWER  CR\# IN CHROMITITES HOSTED BY NORITIC ROCKS ARE INTERPRETED AS THE  RESULT OF INCREASED AL2O3 ACTIVITY CAUSED BY NEW MAGMA INFLUXES.  ELECTRON MICROPROBE ANALYSES ON LINE TRANSVERSES THROUGH 35 CHROMITE  CRYSTALS INDICATE THAT THEY ARE RIMMED AND/OR EXTENSIVELY ZONED. THE  COMPOSITION OF CHROMITE IN CHROMITITES CHANGES ABRUPTLY IN THE OUTER  RIM BECOMING ENRICHED IN FE3+ AND FE2+ AT THE EXPENSE OF MG CR AL  THUS MOVING TOWARD THE MAGNETITE APEX ON THE SPINE! PRISM. THIS OUTER  RIM CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER REFLECTANCE IS PROBABLY RELATED TO THE  METAMORPHIC REPLACEMENT OF THE PRIMARY MINERALOGY OF THE LUANGA COMPLEX.  ZONED CHROMITE CRYSTALS INDICATE AN EXTENSIVE EXCHANGE BETWEEN DIVALENT  MG FE2+ CATIONS AND MINOR TO NONE EXCHANGE BETWEEN TRIVALENT CATIONS  CR3+ AL3+ AND FE3+. THIS MG-FE ZONING IS INTERPRETED AS THE RESULT OF  SUBSOLIDUS EXCHANGE OF FE2+ AND MG BETWEEN CHROMITE AND COEXISTING  SILICATES DURING SLOW COOLING OF THE INTRUSION. A REMARKABLE FEATURE OF  CHROMITITES FROM LUANGA COMPLEX IS THE OCCURRENCE OF ABUNDANT SILICATE  INCLUSIONS WITHIN CHROMITE CRYSTALS. THESE INCLUSIONS SHOW AN ADJACENT  INNER RIM WITH HIGHER CR\# AND LOWER MG\# 100MG/MG + FE2+ AND AL\#  100AL/CR + AL + FE3+. THIS COMPOSITIONAL SHIFT IS POSSIBLY DUE TO  CRYSTALLIZATION FROM A PROGRESSIVELY MORE FRACTIONATED LIQUID TRAPPED IN  THE CHROMITE CRYSTAL. SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION OF PRIMARY CUMULUS  COMPOSITION OF CHROMITE AS INDICATED IN OUR STUDY FOR THE LUANGA  COMPLEX IS LIKELY TO BE COMMON IN NON-MASSIVE CHROMITITES AND THE RULE  FOR DISSEMINATED CHROMITES IN MAFIC INTRUSIONS.

ON THE  OUTER SHELF AND UPPER SLOPE AND NORTH OF THE STSF THE CURRENT  DIRECTION OF EROSIVE MOUND SCARPS INDICATES THE DOMINANCE OF THE  SOUTHWARD-FLOWING BRAZIL CURRENT BC. THIS SUGGESTS A NORTHERNMOST  BOUNDARY FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE STSF. A STRONG FLUX OF THE BC  FAVORED BY A STEEPER SLOPE AS WELL AS BY THE OCCURRENCE OF CANYONS  INCISED ON THE UPPER SLOPE IS EVIDENCED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF COARSER  SEDIMENTS AND LOW VALUES OF PRODUCTIVITY PROXIES BUT ALSO BY THE  PRESENCE OF DEEP SEA CORAL REEFS.

The integrative approach was mostly congruent between markers and algorithmic methods of species delimitation, suggesting the occurrence of 24 species. Based on morphology and molecular data, Amphiroa rigida, Amphiroa vanbosseae, Lithophyllum atlanticum, Lithophyllum kaiseri, Lithophyllum margaritae, Titanoderma pustulatum, Titanoderma prototypum and Paulsilvella huveorum, which were previously reported for Brazil, are confirmed in this work. Six new species are distinguished by both molecular and morphological traits, and they are provisionally named as Amphiroa sp. 1, Amphiroa sp. 2, Amphiroa sp. 3, Lithophyllum sp. 1, Lithophyllum sp. 2 and Lithophyllum sp. 3. Another 10 species are cryptic and cannot be distinguished based on traditionally used morphological traits. These include Amphiroa sp. 4, Lithophyllum sp. 4, three species that are morphologically named under Amphiroa beauvoisii, and six that share the morphology described for Amphiroa fragilissima. All four markers used were useful for species delimitation. However, a combination of practical aspects and levels of intra- and interspecific divergence values led us to propose the use of rbcL-3P as a standard DNA barcode marker for the Corallinales.",TORRANO-SILVA BN 2018 BOT MARINA,"Guidelines for DNA barcoding of coralline algae, focusing on Lithophylloideae (Corallinales) from Brazil",10.1515/bot-2017-0040,FALSE,Botanica Marina,0.961538461538462,0.153846153846154

Both are clearly distinct from all other Arenosclera by their erect, solid funnel to lamellate habit, larger oxeas, and ectosomal architecture bearing occasional multispicular tracts. An integrative approach to find the best classification for both new species failed to group them and A. heroni, the genus' type species. Nearly complete 28S rRNA sequences obtained from these species' metagenomes suggested instead a better placement for the new species and A. brasiliensis in clade C (sensu Redmond et al., 2013), while A. heroni fits best in clade A. We propose to name three clades according to the rules of the PhyloCode: Arenospiculap, Dactyclonap, and Dactyspiculap, respectively for the clade originating with the most recent common ancestor of the three Brazilian Arenosclera spp.; the most inclusive clade containing Dactylia varia (Gray, 1843) and Haliclona curacaoensis (van Soest, 1980); and the least inclusive clade containing Arenospiculap and Dactyclonap.

IN THIS STUDY  THE MOLLUSCAN DEATH ASSEMBLAGES ON THE AMAZON SHELF ARE EXAMINED IN AN  EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PHYSICAL REGIME IS REFLECTED IN DEATH  ASSEMBLAGES AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS ON  MORTALITY.  INNER SHELF REGIONS OF <20 M WATER DEPTH COMPRISE SIMILAR TO 50\% OF  THE TOTAL SHELF AREA THAT EXTENDS TO 100 M AND HAVE NO RELICT SHELL BEDS  OR RANDOMLY DISPERSED SHELLS ALTHOUGH A FEW LIVING SHELL-BEARING  SPECIES ARE OCCASIONALLY PRESENT. EXTENSIVE DEATH ASSEMBLAGES ARE FOUND  DEEPER THAN 40 M. BIVALVES WERE MOST NUMEROUS ON THE SHELF ALTHOUGH  GASTROPODS DOMINATE AT THE STATIONS WITH THE MOST EXTENSIVE SHELL  ASSEMBLAGES. THE INCIDENCE OF BORING VARIED BETWEEN 3 GENERAL GROUPS OF  STATIONS FROM 5 12 AND 30\% AND TENDED TO BE SIMILAR FOR GASTROPODS  AND BIVALVES. EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TIME ON THE SEDIMENT  SURFACE ALTERNATING WITH PERIODS OF BURIAL WAS FOUND. FEWER THAN ONE  THIRD OF ALL SPECIMENS REACHED ADULT SIZE SUGGESTING SETTLEMENT IN A  MARGINAL HABITAT. IN GENERAL THE MOST ABUNDANT TAXA IN THE LIVING  COMMUNITY WERE ALSO DOMINANT IN DEATH ASSEMBLAGES. THE MOST ABUNDANT  RELICT BIVALVE CRASSINELLA LUNULATA HOWEVER WHICH REACHED DENSITIES OF  5578 M-2 WERE NEVER FOUND ALIVE ON THE SHELF. THIS SPECIES ALONG WITH  OLD REWORKED FRAGMENTS OF CORAL AND BRYOZOANS INDICATE ONSHORE  TRANSPORT FROM SOUTH OF THE SHELF OR FROM THE OUTER SHELF WHERE RELICT  CORALINE DEPOSITS ARE EXPOSED FOLLOWED BY DEPOSITION AND DOWNWARD  MIXING OF SHELLS INTO THE DEPOSIT. IN SPITE OF THE OVERWHELMING  INFLUENCE OF THE PHYSICAL REGIME THE INCIDENCE OF BORING IS COMPARABLE  TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTS SUGGESTING SIGNIFICANT BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF  BENTHIC POPULATIONS.,ALLER JY 1995 PALEOGEOGR PALEOCLIMATOL PALEOECOL,Molluscan death assemblages on the Amazon Shelf: implication for physical and biological controls on benthic populations,10.1016/0031-0182(95)00003-4,Aller,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology",0.959016393442623,1

ALTHOUGH FEEDING PREFERENTIALLY ON  ALGAE AND DETRITUS SOME PARROTFISH SPECIES ALSO CONSUME LIVE CORALS  LEADING TO DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS THAT MAY OFFSET THE BENEFITS OF REMOVING  COMPETITIVE SEAWEEDS. PARROTFISH SPECIES DIFFER MARKEDLY IN TERMS OF JAW  MORPHOLOGY FORAGING ACTIVITY AND EXTENT OF SUBSTRATUM EXCAVATION AND  ARE TYPICALLY DIVIDED INTO THREE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS BROWSERS SCRAPERS  AND EXCAVATORS. THE RECOGNITION OF SPECIES WITHIN EACH FUNCTIONAL GROUP  HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RELATIVE EFFECTS IN TERMS OF BIOEROSION CORAL  FITNESS AND SURVIVAL HABITAT ALTERATION AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS. HERE WE  REPORT ON LIVE CORAL PREDATION BY THE BRAZILIAN ENDEMIC PARROTFISHES  SCARUS TRISPINOSUS AND SPARISOMA AMPLUM IN THE LARGEST CORAL REEFS OF  THE SOUTH ATLANTIC ABROLHOS BANK EASTERN BRAZIL AND COMMENT ON THEIR  CLASSIFICATION INTO FUNCTIONAL GROUPS BASED ON DIRECT BEHAVIORAL  OBSERVATIONS. SCARUS TRISPINOSUS AND SP. AMPLUM ALLOCATED 0.8\% AND  8.1\% OF THEIR BITES TO LIVE CORALS RESPECTIVELY. SPARISOMA AMPLUM FED  AT LOWER RATES TOOK SHORTER FEEDING FORAYS AND LARGER BITES THAN SC.  TRISPINOSUS. BITE RATES AND FORAY SIZE WERE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED TO  BODY SIZE FOR SC. TRISPINOSUS BUT NOT FOR SP. AMPLUM. OUR RESULTS  INDICATE THAT SP. AMPLUM MAY BE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED AS AN EXCAVATING  SPECIES AS WELL AS THE MOST SPECIALIZED PARROTFISH CORAL PREDATOR IN  BRAZIL WHILE SC. TRISPINOSUS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS A SCRAPER OR  EXCAVATOR DEPENDING ON ITS BODY SIZE. THIS FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION  CORRESPONDS TO THE CLASSIFICATION USED FOR THE PUTATIVE SISTER TAXA OF  SC.

How- ever, these locations are not exempt from the arrival of anthropogenic agents, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The present study aimed to determine the occurrence and distribution of POPs in the marine biota of the SPSPA. Sample extractions were performed using a microwave-assisted method. The predominant compounds were PCBs and DDTs, which respectively had mean wet weight concentrations of 62.23 and 9.23 ng g?1 in the tropical two-wing flying fish (Exocoetus volitans), 78.66 and 6.81 ng g?1 in the brown booby (Sula leucogaster) and 43.40 and 3.03 ng g?1 in the red rock crab (Grapsus grapsus).

THE GROWTH COEFFICIENT FOUND IN THE PRESENT  STUDY K 0.069 WAS LOWER THAN VALUES REPORTED FOR DUSKY GROUPER  POPULATIONS FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA 0.087 AND SOUTHEAST AFRICA  0.09. THIS DIFFERENCE COULD BE RELATED TO HIGHER AVERAGE WATER  TEMPERATURES IN THESE REGIONS COMPARED TO THE CURRENT STUDY SITE OR DUE  TO POORER HABITAT QUALITY IN TERMS OF THE SHELTERS AVAILABLE FOR DUSKY  GROUPER INDIVIDUALS TO ESTABLISH THEIR TERRITORIES.

Fish assemblages in tide pools are usually very different from those in surrounding areas; resident species exhibit morphological and ecological adaptations to deal with such a variable environment. In this study, we described the environmental conditions and the fish diversity and composition from four tide pools at the continental margin of the Sa?o Sebastia?o Channel, Sa?o Sebastia?o (23o41'- 23o54'S; 45o19'-45o30'W), in southeastern Brazil. Monthly, from January to December 2011, we sampled four tide pools (12 samples per pool), applying a standard protocol to record environmental variables, and visual censuses to record abundance, richness and composition of fish assemblages. Environmental and fish data were compared among tide pools and periods throughout the year (warm and cold) using both univariate and multivariate analyses of variance. Tide pools showed significant environmental differences, mainly in area, volume and complexity of substrata. We observed 13 species of fishes (10 families), which belong to five trophic guilds (roving herbivores, territorial herbivores, mobile invertebrate feeders, omnivores and carnivores). Density and richness of fish were almost constant during the studied period, except for a reduction in fish density in Sa?o Francisco's Beach during a cold period. However, assemblages from the sampled tide pools differed from each other in composition and relative abundance of species, resulting in four distinct assemblage structures. Bathygobius soporator was the dominant species in most of the tide pools, corresponding to 66% of all recorded fish. The tide pool from Baleeiro's Point was intermediate in size, but was covered by a complex algae community and supported the most diverse fish assemblage, suggesting that habitat complexity may contribute to the diversity of fish.",,"Structure and composition of fish assemblages from São Sebastião Channel tide pools, southwestern Atlantic",10.1590/1676-0611-bn-2015-0128,Pastro,Biota Neotropica,0.954128440366973,1

Semi-structured interviews and tests were made with fishermen selected under the criteria of ""specialists"". The data analysis followed the union model of the different individual competences. Grouping analysis was performed on data referring to the localities of the occurrence of these fish, depth, coloration, and morphological characteristics of the species using the Pearson correlation coefficient (UPGMA). A total of 19 species were named within the snapper group, although three of them could not be scientifically identified. The Lutjanidae family presented the greatest numbers of species (n = 9). Other families mentioned were: the Serranidae (n = 3), Holocentridae (n = 2), Priacanthidae (n = 1), Mullidae (n = 1). The 1:1 correspondence between fishermen's local names and scientific species observed in this study indicates the richness of local fishermen knowledge. Analysis of the LEK related to the feeding habits of these fish and indicated that most were considered as being carnivorous, which agrees with the specialized literature consulted. In terms of their spatial distribution, two categories were detected: locality of occurrence (rivers/sea, coast, and offshore) and depth (surface, mid-depth, mid-depth/deep, deep). The fish were considered locally to be ""winter fish"", based on harvested yields. Most of the interviewees knew little about the reproductive aspects of these fish. The main criteria used to identify, name, and classify the species were based on color and morphological aspects. Much of the information gathered in this study agreed with the published literature, which strengthens the importance of including LEK in planning and decision-making processes.",FERREIRA CALO CF 2009 NEOTROP ICHTHYOL,"Local ecological and taxonomic knowledge of snapper fish (Teleostei: Actinopterygii) held by fishermen in Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil",10.1590/s1679-62252009000300007,Caló,Neotropical Ichthyology,0.952755905511811,0

This extension includes some of the most desirable tourist destinations within the country. The local preference is directed to the model ""sun, sand and sea."" The Marau Peninsula represents one of the most important drivers of economic development in the region. The intensification of activities on the beaches of Marau? results in the increase of tourist flow, real estate development and the establishment of support infrastructure resulting in increasing pressure on local ecosystems. After assessing the degree of anthropogenic changes in this coastal extension, the northern portion stands out as the most impacted area. This includes the beaches of Taipus de Fora, and Tre?s Coqueiros e Ponta do Muta?. Recreational capacity assessment of these beaches indicates that Taipus de Fora holds more than 2,000 users in its peak time. This represents, respectively, over 6.5 and 12 times the number assessed for Tre?s Coqueiros e Ponta do Muta? beaches. However, it is important to point out that Taipus de Fora offers greater beach length and width, around twice the area (6.34 m2) to its users. During interviews conducted in the area, 80% of users reported feeling comfortable with a medium or low occupation of the beach. The survey also indicated that ""infrastructure of goods and services"" is an important variable in this occupation model. Around 42% of users surveyed consider the presence of support infrastructure an important decision variable. Only 16% of users responded that these facilities were not desirable. Results indicate that available recreational area and support infrastructure on the beach are important components for attracting tourists. Therefore, it is important to maintain current conditions of use (occupation density) in order to preserve the quality and recreational attractiveness. This will also help in the preservation of costal ecosystems, including coral reefs.",DE SOUZA FILHO JR 2011 J COAST RES,"Socio-Environment Analysis as a Tool for Coastal Management: the Case of Maraú Peninsula, Bahia, Brazil",10.2112/si61-001.57,Filho,Journal of Coastal Research,0.951456310679612,0

The data showed that the fishermen have knowledge about biological and ecological aspects of the octopi. Two capture techniques are used: octopus fishing (polvejamento) in the reefs and through diving.

Hence, the interest on deeper reefs has happened at a time when shallow reefs are undergoing unprecedented changes. Here we investigated the hypothesis that fish community differed from shallow to deeper reefs due to factors apart from habitat structure and quality and therefore discuss for the first-time insights of a ""deep refuge hypothesis"" from Brazilian reefs. We collected data on fish community, benthic community and physiological conditions of two coral species on shallow (< 6 m) and deep reefs (> 25 m). No significant difference on substratum composition was observed comparing sites and depths. Additionally, physiological data on corals also showed similar oxidative status and growth conditions when comparing the two-coral species in shallow and deep reefs. Conversely, our study demonstrated strong differences on reef fish communities in terms of abundance, species richness, trophic groups, size classes and groups of interest when comparing shallow and deeper reefs. Fish abundance was 2-fold higher and species richness was up to 70% higher on deeper reefs. Also, a significant difference was observed comparing trophic groups of reef fish. Macrocarnivore, Mobile invertebrate feeders, Planktivores, Sessile Invertebrates Feeders and Roving Herbivores were more abundant on deeper reefs. On the other hand, Territorialist Herbivores almost exclusively dominated shallow reefs. Strong differences were also observed comparing the abundance of reef fish groups of interest and their respective size classes between shallow and deeper reefs. Ornamental, Great Herbivores and Groupers showed clear differences, with higher abundances being observed in deeper reefs. Considering size classes, larger individuals (> 15 cm) of Great Herbivores, Groupers and Snapper were uniquely recorded at deeper reefs. Additionally, individuals with > 30 cm were recorded almost exclusively on deeper reefs for all the analyzed groups of interest. Our findings suggest that fishing pressure on the target species may be attenuated on deeper reefs, and these regions may therefore be considered as areas of refuge from shallow water impacts. Therefore, the likely potential for deeper reefs protect species from natural or anthropogenic disturbances increases the attention of marine conservation planning and resource management on including deeper reefs in protected areas.",CIPRESSO PEREIRA PH 2018 PLOS ONE,Effects of depth on reef fish communities: Insights of a “deep refuge hypothesis” from Southwestern Atlantic reefs,10.1371/journal.pone.0203072,TRUE,PLOS ONE,0.948275862068966,0.125

A DETAILED  MORPHOLOGICAL-ANATOMICAL ACCOUNT OF THE SPECIES IS PROVIDED AND ITS  PLACEMENT IN HEYDRICHIA IS DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO CURRENT  CLASSIFICATION PROPOSALS.

THE EVOLUTIONARY  HISTORY OF HEYDRICHIA REMAINS UNCERTAIN BUT AVAILABLE DATA SUGGEST THAT  THE GENUS MAY HAVE DIVERGED FROM THE SPOROLITHACEAN GENUS SPOROLITHON  KNOWN AS EARLY AS HAUTERIVIAN TIMES C. 129.4-132.9 +/- 1 MA FROM SPAIN  AND NEWLY REPORTED HERE FROM SWITZERLAND OR IT MAY HAVE ARISEN FROM A  GRATICULACEAN ALGA SUCH AS GRATICULA DATING FROM MID-SILURIAN TIMES C.  427-435 MA.

THE IMPACT  INDICATORS OBSERVED WERE SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION TRAMPLING HANDLING AND  REMOVAL OF ORGANISMS. TOURISTS AT SONHO BEACH WERE MOSTLY ON VACATION  AND MADE MORE MISTAKES WHEN ASKED ABOUT ROCKY SHORES THAN THE TOURISTS  AT ICSP WHICH WERE MAINLY PARTICIPATING IN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION  ACTIVITIES. AT SONHO BEACH 376 OCCURRENCES OF IMPACT INDICATORS WERE  OBSERVED. NONPARAMETRIC TESTS INDICATED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN  GENDERS P < 0.05 DUE TO THE GREATER NUMBER OF INSTANCES OF SEDIMENT  RESUSPENSION CAUSED BY MALES AND AMONG AGE GROUPS BECAUSE OF THE  GREATER NUMBER OF INSTANCES OF TRAMPLING OBSERVED FOR TOURISTS YOUNGER  THAN SEVEN. A TOTAL OF 236 OCCURRENCES OF IMPACT INDICATORS WERE  OBSERVED AT ICSP AND NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE DETECTED BETWEEN  GENDERS OR AMONG AGE GROUPS P > 0.05. THE AREAS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY  FOR RESUSPENSION AND TRAMPLING MORE FREQUENT AT SONHO BEACH AND  HANDLING MORE FREQUENT AT ICSP. THIS OUTCOME WAS EXPECTED BECAUSE  ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE CONDUCTED AT ICSP BUT NOT AT SONHO  BEACH.

THE EARLIEST  GONORYNCHIFORMS OCCURRED IN THE CRETACEOUS OF BRAZIL AND WEST AFRICA.  CHANOS OCCURRED IN THE FRESHWATER EOCENE DEPOSITS OF EUROPE AND NORTH  AMERICA AND PROBABLY INVADED THE CIRCUMTROPICAL TETHYS SEA DURING  TRANSGRESSION EPISODES. AT PRESENT MILKFISH OCCURS NEAR CONTINENTAL  SHELVES AND AROUND OCEANIC ISLANDS THROUGHOUT THE TROPICAL INDO-PACIFIC.  MILKFISH POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE RANGE SHOW HIGH GENETIC VARIATION  BUT LOW GENETIC DIVERGENCE SIMILAR TO MANY OTHER COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT  TELEOSTS. THE NATURAL LIFE HISTORY OF MILKFISH IS ONE OF CONTINUAL  MIGRATION. ADULTS ARE RELATIVELY LARGE TO 1.5 M OR 15 KG LONG-LIVED  TO 15 YEARS PELAGIC AND SCHOOLING. THEY SPAWN OFFSHORE NEAR CORAL  REEFS OR SMALL ISLANDS. THE EGGS EMBRYOS AND LARVAE ARE PELAGIC AND  RELATIVELY LARGER THAN THOSE OF MOST MARINE SPECIES. LARVAE GREATER THAN  OR EQUAL TO 10 MM LONG AND 2-3 WEEKS OLD MOVE INSHORE VIA A COMBINATION  OF PASSIVE ADVECTION AND ACTIVE MIGRATION. PASSING SHORE WATERS AND SURF  ZONES THEY SETTLE IN SHALLOW-WATER DEPOSITIONAL HABITATS SUCH AS  MANGROVE SWAMPS AND CORAL LAGOONS WHERE THEY METAMORPHOSE AND SPEND A  FEW MONTHS AS JUVENILES. SOME JUVENILES MAY ENTER FRESHWATER LAKES WHERE  THEY GROW INTO SUB-ADULTS BUT DO NOT MATURE. BOTH SMALL JUVENILES AND  LARGE SUB-ADULTS GO BACK TO SEA WHEN THEY REACH THE SIZE LIMIT  SUPPORTABLE BY THE HABITAT. LITTLE ELSE IS KNOWN OF THE DYNAMICS OF WILD  POPULATIONS OF MILKFISH.

CARIJOA RIISEI IS A  COLONIAL OCTOCORAL VERY ABUNDANT IN THE LITTORAL OF PERNAMBUCO BRAZIL  WITH GROWTH BY CREEPING STOLONS WITH AN ARBORESCENT STRUCTURE CREATING  AN OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENT FOR EPIBIONTS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE WORK WERE TO  IDENTIFY THE SPECIES OF OPHIUROIDEA ASSOCIATED WITH C RIISEI AND TO  VERIFY THE EXISTENCE OF SEASONALITY THROUGH THE DENSITY ABUNDANCE AND  FREQUENCY OF SAMPLED TAXA. DUE TO THE KNOWN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE  OPHIUROIDS AND SPONGES RELATED IN THE LITERATURE THE SPONGES FOUNDED  ASSOCIATED WITH C. RIISEI WERE RECORDED. SEASONAL SAMPLES OF THE BEACHES  OF PORTO DE GALINHAS AND GUADALUPE WERE REALIZED. IN GUADALUPE 39 AND  21 OPHIUROIDS DRY AND RAINY SEASONS RESPECTIVELY BELONGING TO THE  FAMILIES OPHIACTIDAE OPHIACTIS SAVIGNYI OPHIACTIS LYMANI AND  OPHIOTRICHIDAE OPHIOTRHIX ANGULATA WERE IDENTIFIED. OPHIACTIS SAVIGNYI  STOOD OUT IN ALL THE ANALYSED STATIONS 48.72\% IN DRY SEASON AND  52.38\% IN RAINY SEASON. THE AVERAGE DENSITY OF THE OPHIUROIDS WAS  10.74 IND/100G OF C. RIISEI VARYING FROM 12.56 IND/ 100 G IN THE DRY  SEASON TO 8.92 IND/100 G IN THE RAINY SEASON. AMONGST THE SPECIES OF  OPHIUROIDS RECORDED IN THE SAMPLES O. SAVIGNYI SHOWED 80\% AND 100\%  FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE IN THE DRY AND THE RAINY SEASONS RESPECTIVELY  AND O. LYMANI SHOWED 80\% DURING THE DRY SEASON. THE PRESENCE OF O.  LYMANI IN GUADALUPE CONSTITUTES THE FIRST RECORD IN PERNAMBUCO STATE.  TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT ALL THE OPHIUROIDS COLLECTED IN GUADALUPE WERE  CONSIDERED JUVENILES 1-3 MM OF DISC DIAMETER THE MICROHABITAT CREATED  BY C. RIISEI MAY BE UTILIZED AS A RECRUITMENT PLACE FOR SOME OPHIUROIDS.  NO OPHIUROIDS WERE FOUND AT PORTO DE GALINHAS BEACHJUST AS FOR SPONGES.  ON THE OTHER HAND THE OPHIUROIDS WERE ALWAYS FOUND WITH SPONGES IN  GUADALUPE BEACH. FOR THIS REASON THE ECOLOGICAL RELATION OF THE  OPHIUROIDS WITH C.

In Brazil, there is currently a moratorium that prohibits the capture of this specie, and in the northeastern coast, a Marine Protected Area was recently established properly justified by the existence a one spawning aggregation. The scope of the present study was the analysis the LEK of fishers with the goal of contributing to the conservation of E. Itajara. The Knowledge of 24 ""experts"" was recorded through semi-structured interviews with fishermen selected based on their expertise. LEK regarding some aspects of the life history of E. itajara, such as its morphology, spatial distribution, feeding, breeding and conservation, was systematized. The interviews were conducted in synchronic and diachronic situations. The data analysis followed the model of unity of the various individual skills, while the consistency of the analysis was tested using a matrix of methods employed in comparative cognitive science. Potential reproductive aggregation sites were identified by experts through projective interviews conducted based on a cartographic database and transferred to a geographic information system (GIS). The LEK of these specialists in relation to the biological and ecological characteristics of E. itajara showed a high level of detail and a high agreement with the scientific literature. Projective interviews are presented as a promising tool allowing spatialization of the information generated through the registration of LEK. Therefore, the visualization of information from the fishermen, as well as its analysis and comparison with other databases, is simplified, thereby contributing to the decision-making process concerning the conservation of marine ecosystem in Brazil. Integration of LEK with scientific knowledge is an efficient strategy for the conservation of endangered species, as it provides important additional biological information that can be used in the process of participative and sustainable management of marine resources.",FERREIRA HM 2014 J ETHNOBIOL ETHNOMED,"Local ecological knowledge of the artisanal fishers on Epinephelus itajara (Lichtenstein, 1822) (Teleostei: Epinephelidae) on Ilhéus coast – Bahia State, Brazil",10.1186/1746-4269-10-51,Ferreira,Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine,0.93125,1

SP. WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN NA,"The type species of Tanacetipathes Opresko, 2001 is Antipathes tanacetum Pourtale?s, 1880. Pour- tale?s did not designate a holotype for A. tanacetum, nor did he indicate which form he thought was the most ""typical"" of the species. Because of the similarities of some of the syntypes with other nominal species, it is necessary to select a lectotype from one of the two groups with predominantly uniserial pinnulation. A specimen with short curved primary pinnules was chosen because it has a very distinctive pinnulation pattern that has been previously associated with Tanacetipathes tanace- tum. With a lectotype of T. tanacetum designated, potential new species of Tanacetipathes can now be evaluated and compared directly with the type species. This is the case for T. paula n. sp., which is described here from the littoral of Archipelago of Saint Peter and Saint Paul (Brazil). This species has a corallum pseudo-dichotomously branched, with primary pinnules arranged in four rows and in alternating biserial groups of two pinnules each. The primary pinnules are up to 1.9 cm in length. The secondary pinnules usually occur bilaterally, on both sides of the primary pinnules, and often in subopposite pairs, especially near the base of the primary pinnules. There are usually 3-9 second- ary pinnules per lateral primary pinnules. The anterior primary pinnules always with only two sec- ondary pinnules arranged in subopposite pair nearer the base of primary.

Analysis of the edges of otolith sections suggests that one translucent and one opaque zone are formed once a year. Observed size and age class ranges for H. plumierii were 218-378 mm total length (TL) and 2-28 years, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth models estimated were significantly different between sexes. The growth models for females, males and all fish were Lt = 298.0[1 - e- 0.59(t-0.08)], Lt = 331.8[1 - e- 0.35(t+1.08)] and Lt = 312.2[1 - e- 0.48(t+0.32)], respectively. Growth is fast during the first 4 years of life, when the average fish size is already in excess of 80% of the asymptotic size. The maximum age observed in this study is greater than those previously reported for H. plumierii.

This zone has an important ecological role, due to its mangroves and its location next to Abrolhos coral reef, the most important in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating methods, accompanied by a sedimentological study, were applied to sediment cores in order to establish sedimentation rates and identify historical trends of land use and erosive processes. Sedimentation rates were established according to the ``Constant Rate of Supply{''} (CRS) Pb-210 dating model, which was preferred rather than the ``Constant Initial Concentration{''} (CIC) model. Corrected sedimentation rates obtained from Pb-210 dating were corroborated through a second independent radionuclide tracer such as Cs-137. The sedimentation rates obtained according to the CRS model for the cores were 1.07 +/- 0.13 cm yr(-1) for T\#2 (inner sector), 0.65 +/- 0.06 cm yr(-1) for T\#5 and 0.85 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) for T\#8 (outer sector).

1122,MELO DANIELLE C M 2020 ,2020,GENETIC DIVERSITY AND CONNECTIVITY OF FLACCISAGITTA ENFLATACHAETOGNATHA SAGITTIDAE IN THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC OCEAN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL.,,"THE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY OF THE HOLOPLANKTONIC CHAETOGNATH FLACCISAGITTA ENFLATA WAS INVESTIGATED IN THE TROPICAL WESTERN ATLANTIC TWA. CONSIDERING THE COSMOPOLITAN RANGE OF THIS SPECIES AND THE FACT THAT ITS ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE IS PLANKTONIC THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS STUDY IS THAT F. ENFLATA EXHIBITS CONNECTIVITY DUE TO ITS HIGH DISPERSAL CAPACITY FORMING A PANMICTIC POPULATION AMONG THE STUDY SITES. THE EVALUATED AREAS INCLUDED NERITIC PORT OF RECIFE-PR AND TAMANDARE - TA AND OCEANIC FERNANDO DE NORONHA ARCHIPELAGO-FN ROCAS ATOLL-RA GUARA SEAMOUNT-GS AND SAINT PETER AND SAINT PAUL'S ARCHIPELAGO-SPSPA LOCATIONS OF THE BRAZILIAN BLUE AMAZON. WE USED COI GENE SEQUENCES AS MOLECULAR MARKER. PARTIAL SEQUENCES 425 BP WERE OBTAINED FOR 116 SPECIMENS AND EMPLOYED TO RECONSTRUCT THE PHYLOGENY BUILD AN HAPLOTYPE NETWORK EVALUATE GENE FLOW THROUGH A MIGRATION MODEL AND ESTIMATE DIVERSITY INDICES POPULATION STRUCTURING AND DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORY. HIGH LEVELS OF HAPLOTYPE DIVERSITY MEAN 0.98 AND MODERATE TO HIGH LEVELS OF NUCLEOTIDE DIVERSITY MEAN 0.023 WERE OBSERVED. THE PHYLOGENY AND THE HAPLOTYPE NETWORK TOPOLOGIES SHOWED SOME GEOGRAPHIC CLUSTERING INDICATING LOCAL STRUCTURING IN GS AND PR. THIS FINDING WAS SUPPORTED BY THE AMOVA HIGH GLOBAL PHIST 0.033 SIGNIFICANT AND SOME PAIRWISE PHIST COMPARISONS 7 OUT OF 15 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY >0. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES SUGGESTED LOWER LEVELS OF CONNECTIVITY WHEN GS POPULATION WAS COMPARED TO THOSE OF FN AND SPSPA AS WELL AS WHEN TA WAS COMPARED TO FN. THESE RESULTS MIGHT BE RELATED TO PARTICULARITIES OF THE OCEANIC DYNAMICS WHICH RULES THE TWA SUSTAINING SUCH DISSIMILARITIES. STRUCTURING WAS ALSO OBSERVED BETWEEN PR AND ALL OCEANIC LOCATIONS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PORT INLET ENCLOSURED BY A REEF BARRIER MAY CONSTRAIN THE WATER TURNOVER RATIO AND THUS MIGRATION RATES OF F. ENFLATA IN THE TWA. ACCORDINGLY MIGRATE-N YIELDED A FOUR METAPOPULATIONS MODEL PR ,�� TA ,�� SPSPA+FN ,�� GS+RA AS THE BEST HIGHEST PROBABILITY ~0.90 TO REPRESENT THE STRUCTURING OF F. ENFLATA IN THE TWA. THEREFORE THE NULL HYPOTHESIS OF ONE RANDOMLY MATING POPULATION CANNOT BE ACCEPTED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC EVALUATION DEMONSTRATED THAT THE NEUTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF STABLE POPULATIONS MAY NOT BE REJECTED FOR MOST OF THE LOCATIONS.

THE  ABUNDANCE OF JUVENILE C. ARMATUS 5.6-23.6 CM TOTAL LENGTH IN THE  INTERTIDAL CREEKS WAS HIGHEST DURING NEAP TIDE-NIGHT CONDITIONS AND  LOWEST DURING SPRING-TIDE DAY CONDITIONS. CENTROPOMUS ARMATUS FED  PREDOMINANTLY ON CRUSTACEANS ALPHEIDAE AND PALAEMONIDAE AND FISHES.  STOMACH FULLNESS INDEX I-SF A PROXY OF FEEDING ACTIVITY WAS NOT  INFLUENCED BY SALINITY BUT BY TIDAL-DIEL CONDITIONS. STOMACH FULLNESS  INDEX WAS HIGHEST DURING NEAP TIDE NOCTURNAL INUNDATIONS BUT LOWEST  DURING DIURNAL NEAP TIDES. NEVERTHELESS THE TOTAL DAILY CONSUMPTION WAS  HIGHER AT SPRING TIDE THAN AT NEAP TIDES. HIGHER WATER TEMPERATURES IN  CREEKS DURING NEAP TIDES AT NIGHT COULD EXPLAIN NOT ONLY HIGH C. ARMATUS  ABUNDANCE BUT ALSO GREATER ACCESSIBILITY TO ACTIVE PREY. COMPARISON  WITH THE FEEDING PATTERNS OF FISHES FROM OTHER MACROTIDAL MANGROVE  ECOSYSTEMS SUGGEST THAT THE HABITAT USE AND FEEDING PATTERNS OF  INTERTIDAL FISHES IN MANGROVES ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE  COMBINATION OF SPRING-NEAP TIDE AND DIEL CYCLES.

ONE OF THE OBSERVATIONAL CHALLENGES IN COASTAL REEF  ECOSYSTEMS IS TO QUANTIFY BENTHIC AND CLIMATE INTERACTIONS WHICH ARE KEY  TO COMMUNITY DYNAMICS ACROSS HABITATS. HABITAT COMPLEXITY I.E.  SUBSTRATE RUGOSITY ON INTERTIDAL REEFS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT VARIABLE  EXPLAINING BENTHIC DIVERSITY AND TAXA COMPOSITION BUT THE ASSOCIATION  BETWEEN SUBSTRATE AND SEASONAL VARIABILITY IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD ON  LATERITIC REEFS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC. WE ASKED IF BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES  ON INTERTIDAL REEFS WITH DISTINCT SUBSTRATE RUGOSITY WOULD FOLLOW  SIMILAR SEASONAL PATTERNS OF SUCCESSION FOLLOWING METEO-OCEANOGRAPHIC  VARIABILITY IN A TROPICAL COASTAL AREA OF BRAZIL. WE COMBINED AN  INNOVATIVE 3D IMAGING FOR MEASURING SUBSTRATE RUGOSITY WITH SATELLITE  MONITORING TO MONITOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF BENTHIC ASSEMBLAGES.  THE DATASET INCLUDED MONTHLY IN SITU SURVEYS OF SUBSTRATE COVER AND  TAXON DIVERSITY AND RICHNESS TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN  METEO-OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS AND REEF STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY FROM FOUR  SITES ON THE EASTERN MARINE ECOREGION OF BRAZIL. ADDITIONALLY  CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND BOTH BENTHIC DIVERSITY  AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION FROM ONE YEAR OF MONITORING WERE USED TO  PROJECT BIODIVERSITY TRENDS UNDER FUTURE WARMING SCENARIOS. OUR RESULTS  REVEALED THAT BENTHIC DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION ON INTERTIDAL REEFS ARE  STRONGLY REGULATED BY SURFACE RUGOSITY AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES  WHICH CONTROL THE DOMINANCE OF MACROALGAE OR CORALS. INTERTIDAL REEF  BIODIVERSITY WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH REEF RUGOSITY WHICH SUPPORTS  PREVIOUS ASSERTIONS OF HIGHER REGIONAL INTERTIDAL DIVERSITY ON LATERITIC  REEFS THAT OFFER INCREASED SUBSTRATE COMPLEXITY. PREDICTED WARMING  TEMPERATURES IN THE EASTERN MARINE ECOREGION OF BRAZIL WILL LIKELY LEAD  TO A DOMINANCE OF MACROALGAE TAXA OVER THE LATERITIC REEFS AND LOWER  OVERALL BENTHIC DIVERSITY. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT RUGOSITY IS NOT  ONLY A USEFUL TOOL FOR BIODIVERSITY MAPPING IN REEF INTERTIDAL  ECOSYSTEMS BUT ALSO THAT SPATIAL DIFFERENCES IN RUGOSITY WOULD LEAD TO  VERY DISTINCT BIOGEOGRAPHIC AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS.

The specimens were collected during two field campaigns that covered the entire shelf length, at depths of 5-30 m. In the first campaign (""Petro-UFS""), four samplings took place between 1999?2000. In the second one (""Penaeid""), monthly samplings were carried out in 2013?2014, and covered an area at and between two important estuaries. Overall, we examined 74,387 decapod crustacean specimens. These specimens belonged to 27 families and 78 species, of which 26 species are newly recorded from Sergipe. Considering these results and previous records, Sergipe now has 121 species of marine decapod crustaceans, which represents only ~20% of the species recorded in the northern and northeastern Brazil.

Although the development of spermatangia among the three species is clearly distinctive when viewed with light microscopy, there are only minor differences in spermatial subcellular structure. In the three species studied, spermatangial mother cells (SMC) differ from surrounding vegetative cells by having poorly developed chloroplasts and numerous plastoglobuli. Endoplasmic reticulum is concentrated at the cell periphery, contributing to the formation of the spermatangial vesicle (SV). The spermatangial nucleus is pushed to the upper end of the cell due to an expansion of the large SV and chloroplasts and starch grains are lacking. In the process of maturation, small cytoplasmic vesicles fuse with the cell membrane to form a mucilaginous envelope around each spermatium. Before being released, the SV releases its contents to the outside, breaking the pit connection with the SMC.

A semi-quantitative method was used to investigate the geographical distribution of the two congeners on subtidal rocky reefs along 350 km of coastline by applying a relative abundance index (RAI) to quantify change. Data were compared among 2000, 2004, 2010 and 2011. The indices showed a transition from rarity to dominance throughout the region as well as range expansion; in contrast at one site, where a pilot management initiative of manual control has been carried out, there was a reduction in abundance over time. Abundance values were compared to distance from possible points of introduction to pinpoint where the initial introduction occurred. The observed relationship between the possible points of entry and abundance of the two Tubastraea species was highly significant for the achorage and oil terminal whereas somewhat less so for the shipyard and port. The data obtained in this study are being used to plan further urgent management actions to control the biological invasion of the two Tubastraea species throughout the region, as well as being applied in modeling the range expansion into other regions.",,Corrigendum to “Eleven years of range expansion of two invasive corals (Tubastraea coccinea and Tubastraea tagusensis) through the southwest Atlantic (Brazil) [Estuar.

The ecological relevance of parameters measured at biochemical or cellular level is now considered an extremely important feature in environmental studies, and can be used as early warning signs of environmental degradation. In this context, the effects of acute exposure (9?h) to Cu were assessed on the maximum photochemical efficiency of zooxanthellae (Fv/Fm) and on the activity of key enzymes [carbonic anhydrase (CA) and Ca-ATPase] involved in coral physiology using the scleractinian coral Mussismilia harttii as a biological model. Corals were exposed to different concentrations of dissolved Cu (4.6-19.4??g/L) using two different experimental approaches: a laboratory closed system and a marine mesocosm system. Fv/Fm values and Ca - ATPase activity were not affect by exposure to Cu in any of the exposure systems. However, a significant reduction in CA activity was observed in corals exposed to 11.9 and 19.4??g Cu/L in the laboratory and at all concentrations of Cu tested in the mesocosm system (4.6, 6.0 and 8.5??g/L). Based on the sensitivity of this enzyme to the short period of exposure to sublethal concentrations of Cu in both experimental approaches, the present study suggests the use of CA activity as a potential biomarker to be used in biomarker-based environmental monitoring programs in coral reefs",FONSECA JS 2019 CHEMOSPHERE-a,Corrigendum to “Carbonic anhydrase activity as a potential biomarker for acute exposure to copper in corals”[Chemosphere 227 (2019) 598–605/CHEM59142],10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128846,da Silva Fonseca,Chemosphere,0.6,0.4375

1195,MOURA RL 2016 SCI ADV,2016,An extensive reef system at the Amazon River mouth ,MESOPHOTIC DEEP REEF,"Large rivers create major gaps in reef distribution along tropical shelves. The Amazon River represents 20% of the global riverine discharge to the ocean, generating up to a 1.3 � 106-km2 plume, and extensive muddy bottoms in the equatorial margin of South America. As a result, a wide area of the tropical North Atlantic is heavily affected in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation. Such unfavorable conditions were thought to imprint a major gap in Western Atlantic reefs. We present an extensive carbonate system off the Amazon mouth, underneath the river plume. Significant carbonate sedimentation occurred during lowstand sea level, and still occurs in the outer shelf, resulting in complex hard-bottom topography. A permanent near-bottom wedge of ocean water, together with the seasonal nature of the plume's eastward retroflection, conditions the existence of this extensive (~9500 km2) hard-bottom mosaic. The Amazon reefs transition from accretive to erosional structures and en- compass extensive rhodolith beds. Carbonate structures function as a connectivity corridor for wide depth-ranging reef-associated species, being heavily colonized by large sponges and other structure-forming filter feeders that dwell under low light and high levels of particulates. The oxycline between the plume and subplume is associated with chemoautotrophic and anaerobic microbial metabolisms. The system described here provides several insights about the responses of tropical reefs to suboptimal and marginal reef-building conditions, which are accelerating worldwide due to global changes.",,Faculty Opinions recommendation of An extensive reef system at the Amazon River mouth.,10.3410/f.727251160.793528115,TRUE,Faculty Opinions – Post-Publication Peer Review of the Biomedical Literature,0.581395348837209,0.2

During an expedition to find cnidarians in June 1998 high scleractinian and calcified hydroid diversity was encountered, a richness that in Brazil can only be compared to the Abrolhos, Bahia State): four species of calcified hydroids, twelve species of scleractinian corals, two species of sea-anemones, one species of zoanthid, and one species of octocoral. However, three of the four species of calcified hydroids observed (Millepora alcicornis, M. braziliensis, and Millepora sp.) were bleached or dead and covered by algae and/or invertebrates. Similarly, among the scleractinian corals, bleaching was observed in specimens of eleven of the twelve species recorded (Madracis decactis, Agaricia agaricites, A. fragilis, Siderastrea stellata, Porites astreoides, P. branneri, Favia gravida, F. leptophylla, Montastrea cavernosa, Meandrina braziliensis, Mussismilia hispida, and Scolymia wellsi). Bleaching was associated with elevated average monthly sea surface temperatures, which was at least 1oC higher than the previous year, and at least 1oC above the expected maximum monthly mean, according to remotely sensed data available online from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).",,"Baseline assessment of reef fish assemblages of Parcel Manuel Luiz Marine State Park, Maranhão, north-east Brazil",10.1006/jfbi.2000.1504,Rocha,Journal of Fish Biology,0.530973451327434,0.166666666666667

THE SIMILARITY ANALYSIS CONSIDERING  THE NUMBER OF FISH CAUGHT DURING THE NINE SURVEYS IN THE THREE STUDY  AREAS CLUSTERED THE PRE-MONITORING AND FIRST POST-SETTLEMENT SURVEYS OF  THE THREE SITES. THIS OCCURRED DUE TO THE LOW NUMBER OF FISH CAPTURED  AND THE DOMINANCE OF TRICHIURUS LEPTURUS AND LAGOCEPHALUS LAEVIGATUS.

The present work analysed the association and behaviour of reef fish on the fire coral Millepora alcicornis and M. brasiliensis from September 2010 to February 2011, on the coastal reefs of Tamandar ?e, north-east Brazil. A total of 473 reef fish individuals of 27 species were sighted associated with the coral colonies, mainly composed of juveniles (65%). The most frequently observed behaviours were sheltered/stationary and swimming close to the coral; however, individuals were also observed foraging and breeding among Millepora spp. branching colonies. The agonistic behaviour performed by Stegastes fuscus individuals was highlighted in the present study, especially against Chaetodon striatus, Diodon holacanthus and Ophioblennius trinitatis individuals. Millepora spp. hydrocorals are ecologically important for juvenile and adult reef fish belonging to several trophic guilds. The complex structure of the coral colonies provides a wide variety of ecological functions on coral reefs (e.g. shelter, reproduction area, food and even territory). Nevertheless, the abundance of branching fire coral in Brazilian reefs have been declining over the past years; therefore, efforts must be made to protect this key habitat.",,Feeding association between reef fishes and the fire coral Millepora spp. (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa),10.1017/s1755267212000073,Pereira,Marine Biodiversity Records,0.5,0.142857142857143

1650,SOARES MO 2020 SCI TOT ENV,2020,Why do mesophotic coral ecosystems have to be protected ,Coral reef Twilight zone Climate change DEEP REEF,"Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; ~30-150 m depth) are among the most biologically diverse and least protected ecosystems in the world's oceans. However, discussions regarding the conservation of these unique ecosystems are scarce. To address this issue, we identified the features of MCEs that demonstrate they should be considered as a global conservation priority. Some MCEs are characterized by their well-preserved and unique seascapes; their narrow environmental tolerance and high vulnerability to anthropogenic effects; and their slow recovery and reduced reproductive performance. The unique biodiversity of MCEs includes depth-adapted specialist species and new species, most of which are threatened or important fishery resources. MCEs also provide refuge against human stressors, valuable ecosystem services, and ecological connectivity.

To understand the effects on human communities from including socio-economic objectives in MMAs goals, a cross-site study was designed to examine the socioeconomic and governance effects of MMAs in four countries (Belize, Brazil, Fiji and Panama) as well as ecological factors influencing these outcomes. A socioeconomic and governance monitoring survey is being conducted in each of the MMA coastal communities to understand conditions prior to MMA establishment compared with current conditions. The analysis will assess the MMA effects on food security of coastal residents, livelihoods, human threats to the marine resources, and environmental awareness and knowledge as well as assess the governance effects, including impacts on management structures and strategies, stakeholder participation and representation, property rights and access to resources, management plan compliance by resource users. In addition, enabling factors for MMA effectiveness will be determined. The factors being examined include leadership and long term support of local government, participation by community and all those affected, shared benefits among participants, and alternative livelihoods that may be appropriate in decreasing resource use pressures within MMAs.

From these data, it has been possible to define sea-level fluctuation curves for different sectors. Despite these curves being very similar in shape, Ltis possible to observe some differences in amplitude which cannot be fortuitous. The geoid map of Brazil shows that the coastline of the State of Bahia, approximately in the N-S direction, is parallel to the isobases of the geoidal height. In this case, shifts between different sea-level curves are not observed: for instance the 5100 years B.P. maximum is everywhere situated 5.0m above the present level. Otherwise, the coastline of the States of Sao Paulo and Parana, in the NE-SW direction, intercepts the isobases of the geoidal height. In this case, the sea-level curves are clearly shifted: for instance the 5100 years B.P. maximun varies bet~en 4.5 and 2.5m above the present level. The possibility of neotectonic movements being eliminated, it can be deduced that these shifts could have been caused by a deformation9f the present geoid surface.",,Sea-level change along the French Mediterranean coast for the past 30 000 years,10.1016/s0012-821x(99)00289-7,Lambeck,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,0.455696202531646,0.142857142857143

The crustaceans presented the largest number of individuals and species, followed by Polychaeta and Mollusca. According to the coefficient of Spearman correlation, the number of individuals and species of the not-colonials organisms increase with the growth of the colony. In relation to the colonial fauna, the tunicates had the greatest number of colonies and the sponges the greatest number of species. The epifauna of the colonial and not-colonial groups were more numerous than the infauna. Comparisons between Scleractinia and Milleporidae can be traced because of a possible functional convergence of these taxa. It is possible to assume that the associations with corals do not depend exclusively on the species hostess, as distinct species inhabit the same species of corals in different regions. Probably the substratum had more important function, as its distinct forms promote the formation of habitats.",MARTINS GARCIA T 2008 THALASSAS,"First record of the fireworm Hermodice carunculata (Annelida, Polychaeta) preying on colonies of the fire coral Millepora alcicornis (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa)",10.1590/s1676-06032012000200022,Pérez,Biota Neotropica,0.444444444444444,0.142857142857143

The study sites lie within the most diverse coral reef area in the South Atlantic. Transects were 20 10 long but 10 10 is shown to be adequate for the study area. The average diversity indices for sites surveyed on both islands were low (H'c 0.57 + 0.12), due to a very high relative dominance -and a relatively small number of species. The living coverage in the transects ranges from 10% to 30%. This area under study quantitative data on the required to allow future fragility. The species distribution on both reefs, does not show any nitid zonation pattern; a ""Millepora zone"", as described by Laborel in the 1960's, was not found. Two species (Mussismilia braziliensis and Siderastres stellata) are dominant in all transects. This study has as objectives: a) to describe quantitatively the zonation pattern and species diversity in two fringing reefs (Fig. 1) located in islands in the Abrolhos Archipelago - Santa Barbara and Siriba Islands; and b) to compare our data with those obtained by Laborel (1969). Laborel (1969) did a qualitative study on the ecology of coral populations off the Brazilian coast, including exactly the same sites now under study. Since this contribution, no other study has dealt with this subject up to now, using either qualitative Or quantitative methods. The use of relative living coverage together with the number of colonies is recommended for future works in this area, due to high variation in colony sizes ",,"Community structure and zonation of microalgae and hermatypic corals on a fringing reef flat of magnetic island (Queensland, Australia)",10.1016/0304-3770(80)90045-5,Morrissey,Aquatic Botany,0.444444444444444,0

In the central western Atlantic it supports commercially important fisheries in three geographically separate areas: the eastern Caribbean islands; the southern Netherlands Antilles; and northeast Brazil, although the resource remains unmanaged in all three areas and the stock structure unresolved. Previous tagging studies of H. affinis, in the central western Atlantic indicated very little about the movements of flyingfish off northeastern Brazil, but did show that flyingfish move freely between the eastern Caribbean islands, although they do not appear to travel as far as the southern Netherlands Antilles. However, tagging studies only address geographical movement of fish and cannot discriminate among genetically discrete stocks. In this study, we use mtDNA markers (restriction fragment length polymorphisms [RFLPs] of the D-loop region) to examine the genetic variation and its implication for the stock structure of flyingfish across the central western Atlantic. A total of 360 flyingfish were sampled from the commercial fisheries in the three geographical areas between January and August 1995. Sixty fish were taken from each of the two spawning populations in Barbados and 60 from the spawning populations in each of Dominica and Tobago (in the eastern Caribbean); 60 from Cura�ao (in the southern Netherlands Antilles); and 60 from Cai�ara (in Rio Grande do Norte, northeast Brazil). The mtDNA D-loop region was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and digested to produce RFLPs using five restriction enzymes. Extensive genetic diversity was observed, with distinct composite mitotypes being detected for each of the three geographical areas, indicating a lack of gene flow between these areas and the existence of at least three unit stocks of H. affinis in the central western Atlantic. The results of cluster analyses of composite mitotype sequence divergence and population sequence divergence, and parsimony analysis of composite mitotypes were entirely consistent with a 3-stock model. Furthermore, genetic heterogeneity was detected among eastern Caribbean populations indicating restricted gene flow even within a sub-region and emphasizing the need for more detailed studies of flyingfish spawning behaviour. These results contrast with the typically low levels of genetic variation reported for oceanic pelagic species, and for other marine species (reef fish, spiny lobster, queen conch) in the Caribbean and indicate that major ocean current patterns are not good predictors of gene flow for all species. The implications for management of the flyingfish resource in the central western Atlantic are that three independent stock assessments and management strategies would be appropriate; and that management of the eastern Caribbean stock will need to be at a regional level since the stock is shared between the different island states, while management of the southern Netherlands Antilles stock and the northeast Brazil stock could be at a national level.",GOMES C 1999 BULL MAR SCI,"Restriction Site Mapping of the Mitochondrial DNA of the Four-Wing Flyingfish,Hirundichthys affinis",10.3109/10425170009033243,Gomes,DNA Sequence,0.419354838709677,1

THE  PRESENT WORK DESCRIBES THE FISH FAUNA ASSOCIATED TO MANGROVE ROOTS AT  THE PACOTI RIVER ESTUARY. A TOTAL OF TEN VISUAL CENSUSES OF 90 MINUTES  EACH WERE CONDUCTED YIELDING THE NUMBER OF 671 FISH COUNTED WITH AN  AVERAGE OF 0.74 COUNTS/MINUTE.

The followers benefit from food uncovered or flushed out when reef fishes disturb the bottom. At the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, south-west Atlantic, we recorded the plankton eater, benthic invertebrate picker, and cleaner wrasse�Thalassoma noronhanum,�commonly known as the Noronha wrasse, acting as a very flexible feeder - a kind of ""jack-of-all-trades"" - while following reef fishes. The Noronha wrasse associated with 15 reef fish species, feeding on drifting particles made available as the latter foraged on the bottom. The wrasse displayed four types of feeding behaviour while following foraging reef fishes: 1) eating particles stirred up; 2) eating particles expelled by the foraging fish; 3) eating faecal particles; 4) cleaning fish. The wrasse was commonly recorded following the parrotfishes Sparisoma frondosum,�S. axillare, S. amplum,�and the grunt�Haemulon parra.�The variable feeding behaviour here recorded for�T. noronhanum�while following reef fishes seems rare among follower fish species.

273,CAMARA EM 2019 MAR ENV RES,2019,Hierarchical partitioning of fish diversity and scale-dependent environmental effects in tropical coastal ecosystems,Hierarchical spatial structure Scale dependence Additive partitioning Multiplicative partitioning Multi-scale environmental effects Land use Isolation Fish Coastal zone,"The spatial structure of the fish diversity and site-scale and landscape-scale environmental effects were investigated across hierarchical levels in tropical coastal ecosystems. Total diversity (?) was hierarchically partitioned into ? and ? components using both the additive and multiplicative methods. A model selection based on the AICc was applied to generalized linear mixed models relating diversity measures to environmental variables and including random effects for hierarchical levels and season. Short-term seasonal effects were negligible. Spatial effects were more relevant at the site level and negligible at the subregion level, due to the high spatial heterogeneity and the natural pooling of ecosystems, respectively. Site-scale environmental effects were more relevant at the subregion level, with eutrophic conditions (continental influence) favoring the species richness (? and ?) and higher absence of species (?A) in oligotrophic conditions (marine influence). At the system level, the positive effect of the distance from the ocean on ? and higher ?A in oligotrophic conditions reinforced the positive continental influence on fish diversity. Environmental homogenization processes were most likely associated with the negative effect of the pasture cover on ? at the system level, and ? and ?A at the site level. The negative effect of the forest cover on the later diversity measure evidenced its relevance to maintain richer but more similar assemblages, whereas the positive continental influence was most likely due to the loss of stenohaline marine species. This study evidenced that disentangling spatial, land use, and marine vs. continental effects on diversity components is critical to understand the primary determinants of the fish diversity in tropical coastal ecosystems.",,Disentangling the hierarchical structure of environmental effects on fish assemblages in tropical coastal ecosystems,10.3389/conf.fmars.2019.08.00136,Camara,Frontiers in Marine Science,0.396551724137931,1

Densities of symbiotic algae were significantly lower in�S. stellata�than in any of the other species. Symboints of�Montastrea cavernosa�were significantly larger, and those of�Favia gravidasignificantly smaller, than symbionts from any of the other coral species. The results suggest that cell size may be a useful character in systematic studies of algal symbionts.

In 2002, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment funded a pilot project to assess the status of conservation of Brazilian reefs using the global methods of Reef Check. Six representative regions of Brazilian reefs, between latitudes 3� and 18�S, were chosen for the assessment, including four coastal areas, one oceanic island and one atoll. The selected reefs were located inside the boundaries of marine protected areas of the two main types established in Brazil: fully protected and sustainable use, where extraction is allowed. Intensity of use in this last category was variable, largely depending on local conditions such as human population densities and management regimes. From March 2002 to April 2003, Reef Check surveys were conducted in several sites within this regions. A geographic information system was built using LANDSAT imagery. Reef Check methods were adapted to fit local requirements while permitting collection of the same basic data. Hard coral cover varied between 5 to 35%. Higher cover was found at Abrolhos reefs. Specific hard coral composition varied between regions, with lower diversity of corals registered at northern reefs. Indicator species of fish, including Lutjanids, Scarids, Serranids and ornamental species were significantly less abundant in areas were fishing and collecting were allowed. The same pattern was observed for commercially exploited species of lobster and octopus. Larger species of groupers were generally absent of all areas with very few exceptions. In the summer of 2003 a synchronized bleaching event was recorded. This is the first large scale event registered and shows the importance of large scale monitoring in Brazil",,"Brazil, Coral Reefs",10.1007/springerreference_205836,,SpringerReference,0.371428571428571,0

The reefs are distributed in the following four major sectors along the Brazilian coast: the northern, the northeastern and the eastern regions, and the oceanic islands, but certain isolated coral species can be found in warmer waters in embayments of the southern region. There are different types of bank reefs, fringing reefs, isolated chapeiroes and an atoll present along the Brazilian coast. Corals, milleporids and coralline algae build the rigid frame of the reefs. The areas in which the major coral reefs occur correspond to regions in which nearby urban centers are experiencing accelerated growth, and tourism development is rapidly increasing. The major human effects on the reef ecosystem are mostly associated with the increased sedimentation due to the removal of the Atlantic rainforest and the discharge of industrial and urban effluents. The effects of the warming of oceanic waters that had previously affected several reef areas with high intensity coral bleaching had not shown, by the time of the 2010 event, any episodes of mass coral mortality on Brazilian reefs.",LEAO ZMAN 2016 BRAZ J OCEANOGR,Coral Reefs and Climate Change,10.1007/978-94-007-5784-4_43,Glassom,Global Environmental Change,0.370967741935484,0.285714285714286

This study investigates the spatial and seasonal distribution of macroalgal species, which includes fleshy algae, turf algae and some geniculate and non-geniculate corallines, on two coastal and one offshore reef from Porto Seguro Bay, Brazil. Data were collected during the dry season (JulylAugust 1999) and2 the rainy season (FebruaryIMarch 2000), with samples being taken from the reef wall (at 1, 3 and 5 m depth) and from the reef flat. Macroalgal cover ranged from 33% (reef wall) to 60% (reef flat) on the coastal reefs, and from 36% (reef wall) to 50% (reef flat) on the offshore reef. The most diverse group was the Phaeophyta (19 taxa), followed by Rhodophyta (17 taxa) and then Chlorophyta (15 taxa). The largest number of infrageneric taxa was recorded during the rainy season (FebruaryIMarch 2000), the most abundant genera being Sargassum, Padina, Dictyota, Dictyosphaeria, Caulerpa and Amphiroa. Two species were recorded for the first time in the region: Tricleocarpa cylindrica (Rhodophyta, Galaxauraceae) and Avrainvillea longicaulis (Chlorophyta, Udoteaceae). Algal turf dominated the community structure at all reef sites and habitats. Fleshy algae are the second most conspicuous group on the reef flat in both coastal and offshore reefs. In terms of dominance, on the reef wall, corals and zoanthids are second to turf algae in the offshore reef and coastal reefs respectively.

PARTICULARLY WIND-DRIVEN UPWELLING IS USUALLY  ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERNATING PERIODS OF WATER MIXING AND STRATIFICATION.  IN ADDITION THE EFFECTS OF NEAR SHORE OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS MAY VARY  WITH COASTLINE TOPOGRAPHY AND ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS. HEREIN WE EVALUATED  THE SEASONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE HYDRODYNAMICS OF THE CABO FRIO UPWELLING  SYSTEM BRAZIL IN FUNCTION OF ITS LOCAL BAY. SURFACE AND DEEP WATER  FROM 5 CONTRASTING COASTAL AREAS WERE SAMPLED 13 TIMES DURING THE  SPRING/SUMMER AND IN THE FALL/WINTER PERIODS TO USE TWO-WAY ANALYSIS OF  VARIANCE COMPARING THE MEASURED VARIABLES IN FUNCTION OF SEASON AND  DEPTH. NORTHEASTERN WIND WAS PREDOMINANT DURING BOTH SEASONS BUT IT WAS  MORE INTENSE DURING THE SPRING/SUMMER PERIOD WHEN WATER TEMPERATURE WAS  COLDER AND CONCENTRATION OF NUTRIENTS PEAKED. SOUTHWESTERN WIND WAS MORE  COMMON DURING THE FALL/WINTER PERIOD AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH COLD FRONTS  THAT DECREASED WATER SALINITY INNER THE BAY. CONSEQUENTLY THE  CONCENTRATIONS OF NUTRIENTS CHLOROPHYLLS PROKARYOTIC SECONDARY  PRODUCTION PSP AS WELL AS FLUORESCENT AND NON-FLUORESCENT PARTICLES  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DURING THE UPWELLING SEASON WHILE THE  CONCENTRATION OF PARTICULATE ORGANIC MATTER POM WAS HIGHEST DURING THE  NON-UPWELLING SEASON.

THREE SCENARIOS WERE IDENTIFIED  WATER STRATIFICATION UPWELLING AND WATER HOMOGENIZATION. THE FIRST TWO  SCENARIOS WERE MORE COMMON OUTSIDE THE BAY DURING THE UPWELLING SEASON.  WHEN UPWELLING WAS INTENSE DEEP WATER TEMPERATURE IN THE BAY DROPPED TO  LESS THAN 20 DEGREES C RESULTING IN THE STRATIFICATION OF WATER COLUMN  IN SHALLOW SITES. WATER HOMOGENIZATION WAS COMMON IN THE WHOLE SYSTEM  THROUGH THE NON-UPWELLING SEASON AND WAS MORE PRONOUNCED DURING COLD  FRONTS. OUR RESULTS EVIDENCED A STRONG SEASONAL VARIATION OF CARBON  ORIGIN WHICH WAS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH PHYTOPLANKTON DURING THE  UPWELLING SEASON AND TO POM DURING THE NON-UPWELLING SEASON.

We studied the crustose coralline algal flora to determine if it too is characterized by endemics or ecologically unique characteristics. Corallines thrived under little or abundant fleshy algae but were rare under intermediate algal biomass. Corallines were also rare or absent under filamentous turf , algae. Subcryptic coralline algae under macroalgal canopies were primarily thin Melobesioideae crusts whereas corallines living in shallow zones with little fleshy algae were predominantly the massive and complexly branched species of�Porolithon�and�Lithophyllum, respectively. Coralline abundance varied inversely with herbivory (mostly bite rates of acanthurid and scarid fishes) increasing with depth as both rates of grazing and turf algal abundance declined. Thus the coralline flora, although species depauperate, showed patterns of dominance and zonation similar to those that have been reported throughout the Caribbean.",,"DISTRIBUITION OF CRUSTOSE CORALLINE ALGAE (CORALLINALES, RHODOPHYTA) IN THE ABROLHOS REEFS, BAHIA, BRAZIL",10.1590/2175-7860200758413,Tâmega,Rodriguésia,0.342857142857143,0.1

Additionally, samples were taken from the Itamaraca? Estuarine System (IES), near Recife, for comparison. The data on naturally occurring stable isotopes suggest that export of POM from the IES was restricted to the reef line. This was evident by a maximum of ?13C on the inshore shelf (app. 6 to 15 km offshore). There was no measurable estuarine influence on ?13C of POM and zooplankton on the shelf. No significant differences were observed in ?13C and ?15N between the samples taken at shelf stations off Pernambuco and Ceara? states, although mangrove cover in Pernambuco is more than 10 times higher than in Ceara?. ?13C values of shelf zooplankton varied between -16.3 and -19.8 ?

After ""C/N- correcting"" ?13C values, zooplankton still had significantly higher values than POM. POM ?15N varied between 1.6 and 5.6 ?. Zooplankton was significantly higher in 15N compared with POM at estuarine and shelf stations. The difference in ?15N was 3.2 ?. Decapod larvae showed relatively low ?15N values (similar to or even lower than zooplankton subsamples), indicating a relatively low trophic position. ?13C values of decapod larvae were generally close to the values measured for the oceanic copepod community, indicating a similarity in the utilization of pelagic primary carbon sources.",SCHWAMBORN R 1999 ARCH FISH MAR RES-a,Patterns and controls of carbon stable isotope composition of particulate organic matter in subtropical lakes,10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0178-0029,Gu,Fundamental and Applied Limnology,0.336363636363636,0

The sea anemones were collected between August 12, 2000 and November 11, 2001 with the aid of a scoop, crampon, and hammer. The specimens were stored in labeled plastic bags filled with seawater and taken to the Reef Environment Laboratory (Laborato?rio de Ambientes Recifais - LAR/UFRPE), where they were anesthetized with 20 g of magnesium chloride diluted in 500 ml of seawater and later fixed with formaldehyde at 10%. The coloring and morphological structures of the sea anemones were the first characters to be analyzed; some structures were also measured (with the aid of a caliper and a microscope with an ocular micrometer): the height and diameter of the column and of the oral and basal discs, as well as the number of tentacles of some specimens of each species. In addition, a stereomicroscope was used to analyze anatomical characters such as: mesentery cycles, directives pairs, siphonoglyphs, mesenteric filaments, and gonads. Some cnidae were also analyzed and identified. Up to now, six species were collected and studied: Bunodosoma cangicum Corre?a,1964 in Bele?m & Preslercravo, 1973 Anthopleura cascaia Corre?a,1964 in Dube, 1981, Anthopleura krebsi Duch. & Mich., 1860, Anthopleura sp., Anemonia sp., and Phyllactis flosculifera (Lesueur, 1817), from which four were found in Boa Viagem Beach, three in Muro Alto Beach, three in Carneiros Beach, and three in Forno da Cal Beach. In addition, specimens of the genus Bellactis and some other Acontiaria were observed in Carneiros Beach - a total of seven Actiniaria species were identified during this study.

The present study represents the first SCUBA based survey of the deep reef fishes off the Brazilian coast between 35 and 70 m. A species list was compiled based on visual observations, collections, video recording, and fishes obtained from commercial fishing boats. A total of 158 fish species belonging to 49 families was recorded. Thirty-two species were formally recorded for the first time from the study area, four of which [Apogon robbyi Gilbert, 1997; Coryphopterus eidolon Bo?hlke & Robins, 1960; Psilotris batrachodes Bo?hlke, 1963; and Xanthichthys ringens (Linnaeus, 1758)] represent new records for the western South Atlantic.

The north coast of Brazil, which comprises the states of Amapa?, Para? and Maranha?o from the mouth of the rio Oiapoque to the mouth of the rio Parnai?ba, harbors the largest continuous mangrove in the world, with approximately 8,900 km2. The high discharge of freshwater and continental sediments in the delta of the Amazonas affects the regime of tides, ocean currents, and several oceanographic processes of the north coast, with direct impact on the composition of the biota found in the region. Despite its economic value and intrinsic biological relevance, several aspects of the diversity of the marine and estuarine fishes of the region are poorly known. This situation results mainly from a historical imbalance in terms of the number of studies devoted to increasing the knowledge of the marine biota along the Brazilian coast, such as those dealing with species inventory and taxonomic revisions, which are typically concentrated in the south and southwestern portions of the country. The scientific production focused on marine organisms of the north coast is also imbalanced, and reflects the relatively small number of taxonomists and research groups working on that subject. The insufficient knowledge of the biodiversity of the marine and estuarine fishes of the north coast is an impediment to the implementation of adequate public policies aimed at the management of natural resources in the region.

This zone has an important ecological role, due to its mangroves and its location, next to Abrolhos coral reef, the most important one in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Concerning this study, some traditional parameters parameters (temperature, conductivity, salinity) were used to understand the physical properties, as well as some different ones like: dissolved oxygen, turbidity, suspended solids and nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, nitrite and phosphorus), in order to understand the hydrochemical dynamics of this estuary. Two surveys were done (Winter/2000 and Summer/2001) during different tide conditions (falling and rising). The chemical patterns analyzed in situ, allowed us to classify such water as ""typically coastal"" (tropical water from Brazil's stream), influenced by some freshwater. Caravelas estuary behaves like a typical tide channel, influenced by coastal water. The ""shallow"" coastal water of the Brazilian eastern shelf is typically lack of nutrients (due to the influence of the Brazilian Current) and it receives organic material from small rivers/mangroves systems like Caravelas estuary. During the two surveys, the nutrients' level remained in the same range and with a similar spatial spread. Higher levels were reported on the inner estuary, in both seasons, showing the influence of the mangrove system, and decreased to seaward. The levels reported on the area are typical, and in Caravelas zone the material turbidity has a major role on the fertilization of the surrounding areas",TRAVASSOS MP 2006 J COAST RES,"Circulation and suspended particulate matter transport in a tidally dominated estuary: caravelas estuary, Bahia, Brazil",10.1590/s1679-87592010000100001,Schettini,Brazilian Journal of Oceanography,0.310924369747899,0

Two reef areas on the northeastern coast, mentioned by Laborel, were included in this study. The reef coast is approximately 600 km long and extends from the state of Rio Grande do Norte (approximately 6oS) to the mouth of the Sa?o Francisco River, on the southern border of Alagoas (approximately 10o30 ?S), and consists of many coral and sandstone reefs in the offshore zone and near the shoreline, where the platform top remains exposed during low tides. The second area is located on the central coast of Bahia (approximately 12o35 ?S), with coral and sandstone reefs; and extends to the Abrolhos region (approximately 18o10 ?S), with fringing reefs, isolated columns and offshore banks. Four offshore sites within the EEZ were also included in this review.

To achieve this goal, questionnaires were applied to two grades of three public and three private schools before and after an educational intervention based on 291-strong sample analyzed. The questionnaire included ten items that collected the students' basic data, as well as several aspects on reef environments. In addition, teachers of those grades were interviewed. There were no differences in knowledge between the two types of school; before the intervention, the understanding of the theme was in general poorly constructed in all of the schools studied. However, the five-senses workshop proved to be an efficient instrument for teaching the sciences.",,Use of medicinal plants in the diabetes treatment,10.28933/jhmr-2020-08-1205,first,Journal of Herbal Medicine Research,0.298969072164949,0

The tendency to form these unusual growth forms starts very early, when juvenile coral colonies develop the mushroom head which seems to result from the death of the surface of the parent coral, followed by growth of the colony along the edges. In the tall, mature columns, the expansion of their tops is accentuated by the prolific growth of photophile corals when ""the reefs reach sea level. Under the overhangs, where penetration of light is limited, only the sciaphile forms of corals can grow. Where the growth of these reef columns is dense, they coalesce by their tops forming large compound reef structures that do not display the distinctive zones of the world's living coral reef models. They are shallow bank reefs with a truncated top, an extremely irregular windward side that drops abruptly into deeper waters and lacks the spur and groove system,and without a characteristic back reef zone. These reef columns initiated at depths ranging between 10 and lsm""above Pleistocene carbonate deposits, on the shelf bank reefs, and above non-reefal substrates of older ages, on the shallow reefs adjacent to the coastline.

The main objective of this campaign was to promote principles of environmentally friendly behavior based on the international ""Leave No Trace"" Campaign. In the first phase of the Campaign, managers of nine protected areas established in coral reef sites were invited to be partners. In 2005, with the financial support of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, environmental training courses were developed targeting the five most visited Brazilian beaches with coral reefs (Maracajau, Jo�o Pessoa, Porto de Galinhas, Tamandar� and Porto Seguro). Various outreach materials were prepared: posters, folders, textbooks, stickers, t-shirts, caps and DVD-videos. We also established partnerships with airlines and a public TV channel to broadcast the video, and supported its use at events, such as ""Clean Up Day"", in three beaches: Natal, Tamandar� and Macei�.

South-western Atlantic (SWA ): Brazilian and Argentinian Provinces. A database composed of 733 fish species along 23 locations in the SWA (00�55' N to 43�00' S) was compiled based on primary data, literature and museum records. Cluster and beta diversity analyses were carried out to evaluate faunal overlaps among locations and subprovinces. ""Target-area-distance effect"" and ""stepping stones dispersal"" hypotheses for assemblage composition were tested through Mantel tests. Relationships between the distribution patterns and ecological traits of reef fish species were investigated through generalized linear mixed-effect models. Out of the 733 fish species, 405 are SWA resident reef fishes, of which 111 (27%) are endemics and 78 are threatened with extinction. Cluster analysis detected six subprovinces in the SWA structured following the target-area-distance model, and with no evidence for a latitudinal gradient in diversity. The greatest overall richness and endemic species richness were found in the east-south-eastern region. Depth range, habitat use and body size were the main drivers of SWA reef fish assemblage structure. The Brazilian and Argentinian coasts constitute different provinces structured by oceanographic barriers and environmental filters. Similarities among oceanic islands indicate connectivity driven by stochastic and ecological factors. Species richness and endemism indicate that peripheral provinces may also bear centres of origin and biodiversity, patterns driven by parapatric/ecological speciation and the overlap between tropical and subtropical reef fish species. Ecological drivers of reef fish distribution, such as habitat specialization and body size, support hypotheses of speciation in the periphery. New approaches for spatial planning, marine protected areas and off-reserve marine management are essential for the conservation and sustainability of SWA reef fishes.",PINHEIRO HT 2018 DIVERS DISTRIB,Spawning patterns of commercially important reef fish (Lutjanidae and Serranidae) in the tropical western South Atlantic,10.3989/scimar.2011.75n1135,Leão de Moura,Scientia Marina,0.282758620689655,0.153846153846154

An inter-annual analysis (2002-2017) indicated that this bleaching event was related to anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) that led to the warmest year (2010) in this century (1 to 1.7 �C above average). Such anomalies caused heat stress (28.5-29.5 �C) in this equatorial environment that resulted in a bleaching event. Our results suggest that the increase in SST, low turbidity, and weak winds may have acted together to affect these stress-tolerant corals in marginal reefs. The equatorial coastline of Brazil is characterized by low intra-annual and inter-annual variations in SST, which suggests that the S. stellata corals here may be acclimatized to these stable conditions and, consequently, have a lower bleaching threshold because of lower historical heat stress.",DE OLIVEIRA SOARES M 2019 MAR BIODIVERS,Octocoral bleaching during unusual thermal stress,10.1007/s00338-009-0547-z,Prada,Coral Reefs,0.282608695652174,0.2

Indicators of reef vitality reveal that reefs located less than 5 km from the coastline, the inshore reefs, are in poorer conditions than those located more than 5 km off the coast, the offshore reefs. The inshore reefs are the most impacted by the effects of eutrophic waters associated with sewage pollution, high sedimentation rates and water turbidity, and the most exposed to the effects of bleaching and infectious diseases. From 1998 to 2005, long-term sea water thermal anomaly events, equal or higher than 1oC, were responsible for more than 30% of bleached corals in the inshore reefs. In the offshore reefs of the Abrolhos area, bleaching was milder, but the reefs are strongly threatened by the incidence of diseases that have escalated in prevalence from negligible to alarmingly high levels in recent years. Although bleaching and coral disease have not yet caused mass mortality in the Brazilian reefs, these natural disturbances associated with the effects of global climate changes and human-induced activities, could lead the reefs to higher levels of degradation.",,Climate Change and Coral Reefs,10.1007/springerreference_205794,,SpringerReference,0.276923076923077,0

With an area of 1000 km2, warm and shallow waters, it offers optimum conditions for growth of well-developed coral reefs. Comparing our survey using a video-transect method with data acquired by J. Laborel (1969a), a significant change in the reef coral and octocoral abundance has occurred. Elevated water turbidity was already noted by Laborel, and may have increased in recent decades, due to urban development in the bay surroundings in the last 50 years. A multitude of complex changes in the surrounds of the bay also contributed for the reef decline, including the construction of an oil refinery (1950's), a petrochemical complex (1978), a dam (built in 1985) and a cement plant (built in 1954), due to their chemical and muddy waste discharges into the bay.",,"Human Disturbance, Natural Resilience and Management Futures: The Coral Reefs of Todos Os Santos Bay, Bahia, Brazil",10.5539/jsd.v1n1p13,Dutra,Journal of Sustainable Development,0.260869565217391,1

Four hunting tactics were recorded both in and out of the water: (1) search at pool rims and rock bases, poking into crevices and holes; (2) stealthy approach to previously sighted prey; (3) chasing of prey; (4) ambush from crevices and under rocks. As the chain moray uses varied hunting techniques and its crab hunting is mostly visually guided, its generally unobtrusive foraging attracts little or no attention from tide-pool fishes. Part of the foraging is done out of the water on exposed reefs; fish are therefore unable to follow the moray and take advantage of its hunting activities.",,Erratum: Vertebral Counts of Some Pacific Morays (Family Muraenidae),10.2307/1443492,,Copeia,0.254385964912281,0

HOWEVER INFORMATION ON ITS FISH  COMMUNITIES IS SCARCE. THE MAIN GOAL OF THE PRESENT WORK WAS TO COMPARE  DATA COLLECTED BY TWO DIFFERENT METHODS AND PROVIDE A PRELIMINARY LIST  OF THE RESERVE'S FISH ASSEMBLAGE. THE UNDERWATER VISUAL CENSUS UVC WAS  EMPLOYED TO ASSESS ROCKY REEF FISH COMMUNITY OF ARVOREDO GALES AND  DESERTA ISLANDS AND THE TRAWLING SAMPLES WERE PERFORMED IN THE ISLANDS  ADJACENT AREAS TO SURVEY THE FLAT BOTTOM FISH ASSEMBLAGE. THE MORE  FREQUENT SPECIES ON THE UVC WERE STEGASTES FUSCUS ABUDEFDUF SAXATILIS  MYCTEROPERCA ACUTIROSTRIS AND EPINEPHELUS MARGINATUS WHILE IN THE BOTTOM  TRAWLING METHODOLOGY WERE ATLANTORAJA CYCLOPHORA PORICHTHYS  POROSISSIMUS SELAR CRUMENOPHTHALMUS AND STEPHANOLEPIS HISPIDUS. ONLY 3  SPECIES 33\% OF TOTAL FISH SPECIES WERE REGISTERED BY BOTH METHODS.  TRAWLING SHOWED STATISTICALLY HIGHER VALUES THAN THE UVC IN FISH  RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WHILE THE VISUAL CENSUS TECHNIQUE WAS HIGHER IN  FISH DENSITY AND DIVERSITY.

The aim of this work is to add new information on the abudance, biology, zoogeography and taxonomy of its reef fishes. In the course of four expeditions the fish fauna was surveyed in tide pools and over reefs at depths down to 62 m using a number of different methodologies. Seventy-five fish species (25 new records) were recorded, of which 58 are reef inhabitants and 17 are pelagic. The most speciose families were Muraenidae (seven species), Carangidae (five), Pomacentridae (five), Labridae (four), Serranidae (three), and Scaridae (three).�Stegaster sanctipauli�(Pomacentrdae),�Chromis multilineata�(Pomacentridae),�Melichthys niger�(Balistidae) and�Caranx lugubris�(Caranagidae) were the most visually abundant fishes. Depsite being recorded in prior surveys,�Carcharhinus galapagensis�and�Anthias salmopunctatus�were not observed by our team. It was observed that 60.3% of the reef fish species are carnivores, 15.5% planktivores, 8.6% omnivores, 8.6% territorial herbivores, and 6.9% non-territorial herbivores. Of the 58 reef fishes recorded, four are endemic to St. Paul's Rocks and about 80% also occur off the coast of Brazil. It is thought therefore that St. Paul's Rocks should be regarded as an impoverished outost of the Brazilian province",,The Pelagic Stage of Reef Fishes: The Larval Biology of Coral Reef Fishes,10.1016/b978-0-08-092551-6.50013-1,Leis,The Ecology of Fishes on Coral Reefs,0.24390243902439,0.285714285714286

References on subject are found in descriptions produced by the Stanford Expedition to Brazil, 1911. The Expedition was directed by John Branner, geologist who worked for a long time with David Jordan, zoologist at Stanford. They worked with models of speciation of species and their scientific practices included a variety of methods of natural sciences: biogeographic records, systematic taxonomy (distribution laws), ecological perspectives and collaborative research (biology and geology). This expedition recorded the biogeography of the marine life to understand the role of the isolation on the divergence of species characteristics separated by a natural barrier. The taxonomy developed by these studies involves a knowledge that has acted as a bridge between the old-fashioned natural history and a modern field system. This kind of fieldwork integrated the descriptive activity with qualitative models. Today, the results of the Expedition are reflected in many scientific institutions in North America including biological collections and bibliographies. These indications are important biological records about the Brazilian reefs and they are indicative of the relevant scientific Darwinian work made by this Expedition in a period of the ""eclipse"" of the Darwinian Theory. Thus, we attempt to analyze all these references as a whole, placing emphasis on both the practical science and the history documented in the records of Brazilian coral reefs.

Until 5 Ky BP, reefs developed upward to compensate for a transgressive sea level, exhibiting a framework mainly composed of the endemic coral Mussismilia braziliensis, with colonies reaching up to 1 m in diameter. A 5 m sea level lowering that occurred after this period exposed the nearshore reefs to solar radiation and high influx of terrigenous sediment, causing a catastrophic coral cover decline, from a maximum of 14.5% in fossil reefs to a maximum of 3.5% in living reefs. Currently, reefs are experiencing increasing degradation due to a synergism of natural processes and anthropogenic perturbations such as eutrophic waters, marine pollution, inadequate use, and over-exploitation of reef resources. Bleaching events that registered in the summer of 1993/94, 1997/98, and 2002/03 did not cause mass mortality to the eastern Brazilian coastal reefs, and after six months all bleached corals recovered. Recent studies indicate that annual average rates of sediment accumulation (> 15 mg cm-2 day-1) seem to be detrimental for the vital condition of the coral fauna from the Abrolhos region and an inverse relationship has been found between sediment accumulation and some biotic parameters. Moreover, the results of three years monitoring at the Abrolhos National Marine Park reefs indicate coral damage in sites where intensive diving is permitted. Nutrification of coastal waters, due to contamination of groundwater by domestic sewage, is affecting the community structure of the nearshore reefs in North Bahia, and it is favoring the activity of planktivorous reef macroborers",,"Reef demise and back-stepping during the last interglacial, northeast Yucatan",10.1007/s00338-010-0599-0,Blanchon,Coral Reefs,0.233766233766234,0.25

DATA OBTAINED WHICH ARE SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN VALUES  CURRENTLY INDICATED WERE USED FOR SUGGESTING ANSWERS TO TWO PENDING  QUESTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE LATE PLEISTOCENE AND HOLOCENE SEA LEVEL  RISE. THE FIRST QUESTION INVOLVES THE EXISTENCE AND DURATION OF  STILLSTANDS DURING THE HOLOCENE TRANSGRESSION. NUMEROUS LITTORAL  NOTCHES PRODUCED BY SUBMERSION AT CONSTANT DEPTHS ALLOW US TO PROPOSE  THAT CUMULATIVE STILLSTAND TIME MAY HAVE BEEN A FEW THOUSAND YEARS. THIS  IMPLIES THAT STILLSTANDS WERE FOLLOWED BY EPISODES OF VERY RAPID SEA  LEVEL RISE AND THAT SEA LEVEL CURVES ARE MORE STEPPED THAN IS GENERALLY  INDICATED BY CORAL REEF STUDIES.

THE  GENERAL WEAKNESS OF BIOEROSION ON SUCH ELEVATED BIOGENIC REMAINS FROM  BRAZILIAN AND WEST AFRICAN SHORES MEANS THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT  SUBMITTED TO MID-LITTORAL BIOEROSION FOR LONG PERIODS I.E.

A VOLCANIC EDIFICE RISING MORE THAN 5500 M ABOVE THE OCEAN FLOOR WAS  BUILT BY MAGMATIC ACTIVITY THAT EXTENDED OVER THE LATE PLIOCENE AND  EARLY PLEISTOCENE. AFTER THE CESSATION OF VOLCANIC BUILD UP THE ISLAND  STARTED TO SHRINK DUE TO SUBAERIAL AND MARINE EROSION.

THEY WERE ENCLOSED WITHIN AND PRESERVED  FROM EROSION BY THE MIDDLE TO LATE PLEISTOCENE LAVA FLOWS AND  PYROCLASTIC DEPOSITS. DURING LATE PLEISTOCENE SEALEVEL HIGHSTAND  INTENSE COASTAL EROSION REMOVED THE DISTAL PARTS OF THE ALLUVIAL FANS.  IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT AT THAT TIME THE ENTIRE COAST OF THE ISLAND  EXPERIENCED INTENSE EROSION AND SUBSIDENCE AS DEDUCED FROM THE ABSENCE  OF PLEISTOCENE COASTAL DEPOSITS WHICH ARE WIDESPREAD ALONG MAINLAND  BRAZILIAN COAST.

A mapping effort was conducted to produce detailed bathymetry, high-(spectral, spatial and digital)- resolution imagery, and benthic habitat classification. Scuba-based ecological census was conducted at sixty sites for ground-truthing. Observations logged included substrate type, species or functional groups of Cnidaria (Anthozoa and Hidrozoa Classes), and functional groups of flora. A visual estimate of coverage areas was provided in a semi-quantitative hierarchy. High-definition videography and photography, as well as sediment and foraminifera sampling were also carried out. RGB triplets highlight WorldView 2's Coastal Blue Band capable of penetrating the water column. The Quick Bird scene was used for comparison and in decorrelation stretch. Heads-up, on-screen photo-interpretation over select RGB triplets generated polygons in the GIS. The processing took into consideration the geomorphology, interpreted from a bathymetry dataset and its derivatives (selected isobaths, hillshade, classified slope), as well as a generalized Inverse Distance Weighed model of the predominant bottom type compiled from the scuba-based videography-and-field-book database stored in the GIS. The resulting classification scheme used three basic attributes to describe each mapped polygon. Coral cover is generally low in the shallower water and increases with water depth.

There were no mass coral death associated to these events and the affected corals fully recovered after the impact. The first occurrence was registered during the southern hemisphere summer of 1993/1994, in Abrolhos, when 50 to 90% of the coral colonies were bleached. In the North Coast of Bahia, during the summer of 1997/1998, a sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly of 1 �C matched with SST registered in the field (29 to 30.5 �C). As a result, up to 60% corals bleached. From 1998 to 2005 anomalies of 0.25 �C, for two weeks, caused bleaching in more than 10% corals from the coastal reefs, which are located adjacent or less than 5 km from the coastline. However in the Abrolhos region, where reefs are located more than 10 km from the continent, only SST anomalies higher than 0.50 �C, persisting for more than two weeks, caused bleaching up to 10% of the investigated corals. Mussismilia hispida, Siderastrea spp., Montastraea cavernosa, Agaricia agaricites and Porites astreoides were the coral species most severely impacted by bleaching, and they are also the most common species in the coastal reefs. All species presented different levels of bleaching, 'light' or 'heavy'. In Bahia, there is a strong linkage between coral bleaching and periods of elevated sea surface temperature, and the most affected corals were the ones from the coastal reefs. These coastal reefs are exposed to the impacts from processes occurring in the continent, suggesting that corals exposed to high levels of nutrient and sediment loads, and large SST fluctuations, may be more resistant to the post bleaching effects, such as infectious diseases and mass mortality.",,Effects of modeled tropical sea surface temperature variability on coral reef bleaching predictions,10.1007/s00338-011-0825-4,van Hooidonk,Coral Reefs,0.212121212121212,0.083333333333333

Coral reefs, in Brazil are distributed along 3,000 km of the northeastern coast as the only reef ecosystem in the South Atlantic. Nine MPAs have been created over coral reef ecosystems, and several other measures have been taken in order protect coral reefs, including a significant number of conventions, laws, norms and procedures. Brazil was the first country to sign the Convention of the Biological Diversity and this commitment has stimulated a series of conservation measures. In this context, the Law of Environmental Crimes and the Law of the National System of Conservation Units were of special significance. In addition, the Ministry of the Environment in partnership with other institutions has created a number of programs. Some examples are the 'Atlas of Coral Reef Protected Areas in Brazil', the Coral Reefs Conservation Campaign and the Brazilian Coral Reef Monitoring Program.

Species richness is higher than previously reported, but considerable lower than that of the Caribbean region. A specieslarea relationship may explain the lower species richness of the Southwestern Atlantic, besides other historical and ecological factors. Levels of endemism within reef fish families are highly variable (0-loo%), showing a negative association with dispersion capabilities. The wide taxonomic spectrum of fishes bearing Brazilian- endemic species indicates that major cladogenetic events isolated some groups in the southwestern Atlantic. Plio- Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations account for breaking gene flow between the Caribbean and the southwestern Atlantic during regressive periods, but the lack of phylogenetic evidences supporting area relationships complicates biogeographical analyses. Multiple historical factors seem to be responsible for the present composition of the Brazilian reef fish fauna.

Maximum-parsimony and distance analyses were employed to investigate biogeographical relationships among those areas. A collection of 26 phylogenies of various Atlantic reef fish taxa was used to assess patterns of origin and diversification relative to evolutionary scenarios based on spatio-temporal sequences of species splitting produced by geological and palaeoceanographic events. We present data on faunal (species and genera) richness, endemism patterns, diversity buildup (i.e. speciation processes), and evaluate the operation of the main biogeographical barriers and/or filters. Phylogenetic (proportion of sister species) and distributional (number of shared species) patterns are generally concordant with recognized biogeographical provinces in the Atlantic. The highly uneven distribution of species in certain genera appears to be related to their origin, with highest species richness in areas with the greatest phylogenetic depth. Diversity buildup in Atlantic reef fishes involved (1) diversification within each province, (2) isolation as a result of biogeographical barriers, and (3) stochastic accretion by means of dispersal between provinces. The timing of divergence events is not concordant among taxonomic groups. The three soft (non-terrestrial) inter-regional barriers (mid-Atlantic, Amazon, and Benguela) clearly act as 'filters' by restricting dispersal but at the same time allowing occasional crossings that apparently lead to the establishment of new populations and species. Fluctuations in the effectiveness of the filters, combined with ecological differences among provinces, apparently provide a mechanism for much of the recent diversification of reef fishes in the Atlantic. Our data set indicates that both historical events (e.g. Tethys closure) and relatively recent dispersal (with or without further speciation) have had a strong influence on Atlantic tropical marine biodiversity and have contributed to the biogeographical patterns we observe today; however, examples of the latter process outnumber those of the former.",FLOETER SR 2008 J BIOGEOG,"Critical comments on the South Atlantic puzzle of reef fish biogeography [J.-C.

In the tropical Atlantic, the study of 19th and early 20th century literature shows that very dense populations of Vermetids (often quoted as Serpulae) were active in areas wh~re recent exploration is not able to find them. In some areas, populations which flourished 70 years ago, have now completely vanished. Similarly studies of fossil vermetid rock lines above present water level, representative of holocene high water stands along the coasts of Brazil and West Africa, reveal that fossil populations of these species were more developed and more widely distributed than at present. The various genera of Vermetids have not been affected to the same extent. Petaloconchus (Macrophragma) , which prefers relatively calm waters, is nearly extinct in the region of our study; whereas Dendropoma (Novastoa) , a surf loving genus, survives and is still flourishing in many places. It is still premature to propose an explanation for such ~henomena. We do not know whether it is worldwide, or restricted. However, it does not seem to be linked to human activity, since the general narrowing of the areas of repartition suggests climatic changes.",,Vocabulary Building,10.2307/3198541,Raven I.,South Atlantic Bulletin,0.142857142857143,0.125

98,ARMESTO 2012 AQUA,2012,Testing for camouflage of the Brazilian seahorse�Hippocampus reidi�(Syngnathidae) using the territorial damselfish�Stegastes fuscus�(Cuvier) (Pomacentridae),,"Seahorses present many characteristics such as variable colour, skin fronds and sedentary behaviour that provide camouflage as a defense mechanism. This study aims to test seahorse camouflage effectiveness in relation to a territorial species. Seahorses were translocated into the territory of the damselfish Stegastes fuscus (Cuvier) and its aggressive behaviour was recorded. Stegastes fuscus was chosen as being a good model of an aggressive fish, probably able to detect any transgressor. Seahorse size, sex, colour and mobility were recorded, as was the colour of the substrate used as holdfast. Eighty-four percent of the translocated seahorses were not attacked. There was no relation between number of attacks and size, sex or colour of seahorse and its holdfast. Seahorses that remained still during the experiment (84%) were not attacked, but those that moved were attacked (16%). It was observed in this study that neither seahorse color nor size were relevant characters in camouflage fitness, but probably all these together, including behavior, improved survival fitness",,ff,10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.09578,,Oxford Music Online,0.012820512820513,0
90,ARAUJO JN 2009 J APPL ICHTHYOL,2009,ASPECTS OF THE POPULATION BIOLOGY OF CEPHALOPHOLIS FULVA FROM THE  CENTRAL COAST OF BRAZIL,NA GROWTH AGE MORTALITY VALIDATION FISHES BLOCH REEF,AGE AND SIZE COMPOSITION SAMPLES OF CEPHALOPHOLIS FULVA FROM THE CENTRAL  COAST OF BRAZIL WERE COLLECTED FROM RESEARCH SURVEYS AND FROM LINE  FISHERY LANDINGS BETWEEN 1997 AND 1999. THE SAMPLES SUGGEST THAT THE  SUBMARINE BANKS LOCATED FURTHER OFFSHORE ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HAVING  FISH LARGER THAN THOSE CAUGHT IN THE CONTINENTAL SHELF AREA. ALTHOUGH  THE OLDEST SPECIMENS WERE CAUGHT IN THE CONTINENTAL SHELF AREA ONLY  34.6\% OF THE SPECIMENS WERE OLDER THAN 10 YEARS AS COMPARED TO 51.4\%  IN THE SUBMARINE BANKS. THE OBSERVED SIZE AND AGE DIFFERENCES SEEM TO BE  RELATED TO THE LOWER FISHING PRESSURE ON THE SUBMARINE BANKS ALTHOUGH  SIZE COMPOSITION BIAS RESULTING FROM DIFFERENT SAMPLING PROCEDURES AND  DIFFERENT CATCHABILITY BETWEEN SITES CANNOT BE EXCLUDED. A RESAMPLING  SCHEME WAS USED TO OVERCOME THE INFLUENCES OF SIZE COMPOSITION BIAS AND  TO GENERATE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL PLOT OF PARAMETERS AS A MEANS TO COMPARE  THE GROWTH BETWEEN THE SUBMARINE BANKS AND THE CONTINENTAL SHELF AREA  THIS PLOT SHOWED NO OVERLAP BETWEEN GROWTH PATTERNS OF THE TWO SITES.  THE NATURAL MORTALITY M ESTIMATE BASED ON THE OLDEST SPECIMEN OBSERVED  WAS 0.17 YEAR-1. TOTAL MORTALITY Z ESTIMATED FROM CATCH-CURVE  ANALYSES USING SAMPLES FROM BOTH AREAS VARIED FROM 0.24 TO 0.34  YEAR-1 DEPENDING ON THE AGE RANGE USED. WITH THIS LEVEL OF MORTALITY  THE C.
