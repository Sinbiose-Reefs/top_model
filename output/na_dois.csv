A DETAILED MORPHOLOGICAL-ANATOMICAL ACCOUNT OF THE SPECIES IS PROVIDED, AND ITS PLACEMENT IN HEYDRICHIA IS DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO CURRENT CLASSIFICATION PROPOSALS.

TODAY, POROUS NUMMULITOID LIMESTONES, WHICH OCCUR GLOBALLY FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE INDO-PACIFIC, FORM POTENTIALLY VALUABLE OIL RESERVOIRS. UNTIL NOW THE ORIGIN, EVOLUTION AND PALAEOGEOGRAPHIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE NUMMULITOIDS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ARTICULATED, BUT NEW MATERIAL ALLOWS HERE THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC, GLOBAL BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC COMPARISON AND CORRELATION OF THE NUMMULITOIDS TO BE MADE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE NINRUNULITOIDS ORIGINATED IN THE AMERICAS DURING THE MIDDLE PALEOCENE (SELANDIAN). THESE EARLY NUMMULITOIDS ARE INFERRED TO HAVE MIGRATED ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN THE LATE PALEOCENE (THANETIAN) FOLLOWING TWO PATHS: SOUTH TOWARDS SW AFRICA, AND NORTHEASTWARD THROUGH THE TETHYAN CORRIDOR. THE TETHYAN FORMS EVOLVED DURING THE EOCENE INTO MANY LINEAGES, WHICH IN TURN MIGRATED, WITHIN A FEW MILLION YEARS OF THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE, INTO THE INDO-PACIFIC, WHERE THEY BECAME ISOLATED AND DIVERSIFIED FURTHER. MEANWHILE THE SW AFRICAN FORMS REMAINED SMALL AND SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL AMERICAN STOCK UNTIL THE EARLY MIOCENE (BURDIGALIAN), WHEN ASSEMBLAGES WERE AUGMENTED BY FORMS THAT MIGRATED FROM TETHYS, AN EVENT ESTABLISHED BY THE DISCOVERY OF NEW MEDITERRANEAN-DERIVED SPECIES OF PLANOSTEGINA IN SW AFRICA: AFRICANA, MCMILLLANIA, SOUTHERNIA, LANGHIANA. CLIMATIC AND TECTONIC PROCESSES CONTRIBUTED TO THE MIDDLE OLIGOCENE DISAPPEARANCE OF NUMMULITES AND THE EARLY MIOCENE GLOBAL EXTINCTION OF SPIRODYPEUS AND OF CYCLODYPEUS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.

THE POOL CLOSEST TO THE INNER FRINGE OF THE REEF HAD LOWER SALINITY AND HIGHER TEMPERATURE DUE TO INFLOW OF GROUNDWATER. THE OTHER POOLS VARIED ONLY WITH RESPECT TO THEIR MORPHOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, ALGAL COVER, AND BOTTOM COMPOSITION. SPECIES WITH A STRONG AFFINITY FOR ESTUARINE-LIKE WATERS CHARACTERIZED THE POOL CLOSEST TO THE BEACH AND DISTINGUISHED ITS FISH COMMUNITY FROM THAT OF THE OTHER POOLS. INSTEAD OF BEING STRONGLY STRUCTURED BY THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL SETTING AND POSITION IN THE REEF, FISH COMMUNITIES OF THE OTHER POOLS WERE DETERMINED BY BEHAVIORAL PREFERENCES AND INTRA- AND INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS. DIFFERENCES IN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE WERE RELATED TO POOL SIZE (THE LARGER SIZES PERMITTING THE PERMANENCY OF SCHOOLING SPECIES), TO ALGAL COVER (WHICH ALLOWED CAMOUFLAGE FOR LARGE PREDATORY SPECIES), TO BOTTOM COMPOSITION (WHICH PROVIDED SUBSTRATE FOR TURF FLORA AVAILABLE TO TERRITORIAL HERBIVORES), AND TO ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS (E.G., COMPETITION, TERRITORIALITY, AND PREDATION). ALTHOUGH DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF TIDEPOOL FISHES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN RELATED TO THE AVAILABILITY OF NICHES, INDEPENDENT OF POOL POSITION IN THE REEF, OUR RESULTS SHOW SYNERGISTIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN WATER PROPERTIES, PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF NICHES, AND ECOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS IN STRUCTURING TIDEPOOL FISH COMMUNITIES.;MACIEIRA RM, 2011, FISH BULL;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BRITTLE STAR SAMPLES FROM THIS REGION WERE COLLECTED AS PART OF THE `CAMPOS BASIN DEEP SEA ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT/PETROBRAS'. THIS STUDY AIMED TO CHARACTERIZE THE ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY INCLUDING SPECIES RICHNESS, AND ALSO DETECT SIGNIFICANT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN THE BRITTLE STAR POPULATION STRUCTURE. DURING FEBRUARY AND AUGUST (SUMMER AND WINTER, RESPECTIVELY) 2003, 36 SAMPLING TRAWLS WERE TAKEN USING AN OTTER TRAWL SEMI-BALLOON, WITH A 5.5 M(2) OPENING AND I 6 MM MESH SIZE, AT THREE DIFFERENT DEPTHS (1100, 1300 AND 1600 M) IN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN AREAS OF CAMPOS BASIN.

IN GENERAL, THE STUDIED CARBONATE SUCCESSIONS EVOLVED DURING THREE DEPOSITIONAL STAGES: 1) IN THE OLIGOCENE A WARM PERIOD PREVAILED WHERE TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE ORGANISMS, SUCH AS LARGER BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA, CORALS, ALGAE AND ARTHROPODS THRIVED IN A REEFAL SETTING. FOUR DIFFERENT BENTHIC FORAMINIFERAL BIOZONES (BF1 - BF4) WERE DEFINED BASED UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF THE FOLLOWING FORAMINIFERAL ASSEMBLAGES WHICH WERE DOMINATED BY (BF1) LEPIDOCYCLINIDS, (BF2) MIOGYPSINIDS, (BF3) MIOGYPSINA-AMPHISTEGINA, AND (BF4) MIOGYPSINA AND HETEROSTEGINA. THESE BIOZONES, ARE EQUIVALENT TO THE P18-P22 PLANKTONIC FORAMINIFERAL BIOZONES, AND REFLECT TEMPORAL CHANGES OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MINOR SEA LEVEL FLUCTUATION. 2) THE WARM PERIOD CONTINUED THROUGH THE EARLY MIOCENE, WHERE CORALS, BRYOZOANS, RARE PLANKTONIC FORAMINIFERA AND LARGER BENTHIC FORAMINIFERA THRIVED IN CLEAR AGITATED WATERS OF A FOREREEFAL SETTING. THIS PERIOD WAS REPRESENTED BY TWO BENTHIC FORAMINIFERAL ZONES, BF5 - BF6, EQUIVALENT TO THE N4-N7 PLANKTONIC FORAMINIFERAL BIOZONES. MIOGYPSINIDS, LEPIDOCYCLINA AND HETEROSTEGINA DOMINATE BF5, WHILE ATTACHED FORMS GROWING IN A MASSIVE BRANCHING STRUCTURE, SUCH AS SPORADOTREMA ARE PROMINENT IN BF6. 3) THE THIRD DEPOSITIONAL STAGE IS REFLECTED BY A RAPID DEEPENING OF THE CARBONATE FACIES AT THE ONSET OF THE MIDDLE MIOCENE, COEVAL WITH A GLOBAL WARMING EVENT, THE SO-CALLED MID-MIOCENE CLIMATIC MAXIMUM. THIS RESULTED IN THE REPLACEMENT OF THE REEFAL ORGANISMS BY PELAGIC SEDIMENTS CONTAINING PLANKTONIC FORAMINIFERA. THE PLANKTONIC FORAMINIFERAL BIOZONES PF1 AND PF2 ARE EQUIVALENT TO N8-N12 PLANKTONIC FORAMINIFERAL BIOZONES, AND WERE PRESENT IN ALL WELLS. THIS RAPID SEA LEVEL CHANGE IS INFERRED TO BE RELATED TO A GLOBAL WARMING EVENT AND RELATED OCEANOGRAPHIC CHANGES. THE HIGH RESOLUTION DEPOSITIONAL AND BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC SCHEME PUT FORWARD HERE FOR THE CAMPOS BASIN WILL ENABLE A MORE DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENERAL REGIONAL EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT CENOZOIC CARBONATE FACIES THAT ARE FOUND OFF THE ATLANTIC MARGINS OF SOUTH AMERICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND WEST AFRICA.;BOUDAGHER-FADEL MK, 2010, STRATIGRAPHY;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MOST OF THESE RECORDS ARE FROM THE DEEP-SEA, ESPECIALLY FROM SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC SEAMOUNTS AND THE BRAZILIAN CONTINENTAL SHELF MARGINS. MOST SPECIMENS WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN 13 DEGREES AND 22 DEGREES S, DURING A STUDY TO SURVEY THE LIVING RESOURCES OFF BRAZIL (REVIZEE PROGRAM), CARRIED OUT BY THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT. THIS PAPER IS AN HISTORICAL OVERVIEW CONCERNING THE GEOGRAPHIC AND BATHYMETRIC DISTRIBUTION OF BLACK CORAL SPECIES REPORTED OFF BRAZIL. THE GENUS CHRYSOPATHES IS HEREIN REPORTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND THE FAMILY APHANIPATHIDAE (SUBFAMILIES ACANTHOPATHINAE AND APHANIPATHINAE) IS REPORTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SOUTHWESTERN ATLANTIC.;LOIOLA LDL, 2007, CONSERVATION AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF SEAMOUNT AND DEEP-SEA CORAL ECOSYSTEMS;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SPAWNING OCCURRED DURING FEBRUARY THROUGH THE MID-MARCH IN THE ABROLHOS REEF COMPLEX, AND DECEMBER TO EARLY JANUARY IN BUZIOS. SEA TEMPERATURE IS MOST LIKELY THE MAJOR FACTOR INFLUENCING THE GAMETOGENESIS OF THIS SPECIES AND THIS LATITUDINAL VARIATION WAS PROBABLY RELATED TO THE UPWELLING THAT OCCURS ON BUZIOS DURING THE SUMMER.

TWELVE FISH SPECIES IN SEVEN FAMILIES WERE RECORDED FEEDING ON DOLPHIN OFFAL. THE BLACK DURGON (MELICHTHYS NIGER) WAS THE MOST UBIQUITOUS WASTE-EATER, AND ITS GROUP SIZE WAS POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH DOLPHIN GROUP SIZE.

BRAZILIENSIS FROM BRAZIL AND M. SQUARROSA FROM THE CARIBBEAN (TO ADDRESS CONFUSION OVER THEIR SYNONYMY). ONE HUNDRED AND THREE COLONIES OF MILLEPORA WERE COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS SITES ALONG THE BRAZILIAN COAST. IN AN ATTEMPT TO FACILITATE DELINEATION AMONG SPECIES, DIAMETERS OF THE GASTROPORES AND DACTYLOPORES WERE COMPARED IN ADDITION TO OTHER MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS. WE PROPOSED THAT THE COLONIES COLLECTED FROM BRAZIL COMPRISED FOUR SPECIES: M. ALCICORNIS (34 COLONIES), M. BRAZILIENSIS (45), M. NITIDA (13), AND ONE PREVIOUSLY UNDESCRIBED SPECIES (11). ANALYSES OF VARIANCE OF THE DIAMETERS OF GASTROPORES AND DACTYLOPORES AMONG THE VARIOUS SPECIES SHOWED CONSIDERABLE INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIABILITY AND SOME INTER-SPECIFIC SPATIAL VARIATION. AT THE ABROLHOS ISLANDS, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE DETECTED BETWEEN M. ALCICORNIS, M. BRAZILIENSIS AND M. NITIDA FOR THE MEAN DIAMETER OF THE DACTYLOPORES, BUT NOT THE GASTROPORES.

THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE STATUS OF KNOWLEDGE OF BRAZILIAN REEFS, WITH EMPHASIS ON CORAL COMMUNITIES. LARGER REEF CORAL COMMUNITIES WERE RECORDED FROM NEAR THE EQUATOR (00 DEGREES 53'S) TO CAPE FRIO (23 DEGREESS), BUT THE SOUTHERNMOST TRUE REEFS ARE IN THE ABROLHOS AREA ( 18 DEGREESS). FIFTEEN SCLERACTINIAN SPECIES FROM BRAZILIAN REEFS (FIVE ENDEMICS) HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED.

HOWEVER, `PARCEL DO MANUEL LUIZ' SEEMS TO HARBOR A UNIQUE CORAL COMMUNITY ESTABLISHED ON A ROCKY STRUCTURE. NORTHEASTERN REEFS HAVE MOSTLY LONG LINES OF FRINGING REEFS (MANY ON BEACH ROCKS), WITH SUBMERGED PARALLEL LINES OFFSHORE. EASTERN REEFS ARE UNIQUELY CHARACTERIZED BY THE MAJOR REEF BUILDER SPECIES MUSSISMILIA BRAZILIENSIS (ENDEMIC IN THIS REGION) AND PINNACLES (CHAPEIROES) AS AN IMPORTANT REEF STRUCTURE (SOMETIMES FUSED TO FORM BANK REEFS).

TRANSVERSUS IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON BRACHYURAN CRAB LIVING IN THE MARINE ROCKY INTERTIDAL OF SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL. HOWEVER, ITS BIOLOGY IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. IN THIS STUDY, SOME ASPECTS OF THE POPULATION BIOLOGY OF THIS SPECIES ARE INVESTIGATED. DISTRIBUTION OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE INTERTIDAL RANGE IS HETEROGENEOUS. SABELLARIID WORM REEFS AND MYTILID MUSSEL BEDS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS NURSERY GROUNDS RETAINING MOST PART OF JUVENILES, WHILE THE ROCKY SURFACE IS MOSTLY INHABITED BY ADULTS, WHICH FIND SAFETY SHELTERS IN ROCK CREVICES. ANNUAL SIZE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS REVEALED CLUES OF POPULATION STABILITY AND INDICATED THAT YOUNG INDIVIDUALS REACH THE ADULT HABITAT IN A GRADUAL PROCESS. SEX-RATIO FOLLOWS THE 1:1 PROPORTION IN SMALLER SIZE CLASSES BUT IS BIASED TOWARDS MALES IN LARGER ONES. HIGHER MORTALITY IN LARGER FEMALES IS INDICATED AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THIS PATTERN. OVIGEROUS RATIO SHOWS A REMARKABLE SEASONALITY IN WHICH HIGHEST PERCENTAGES OF OVIGEROUS FEMALES OCCUR DURING SUMMER MONTHS, WHILE RECRUITMENT OF YOUNG IS MORE INTENSE FROM APRIL TO JULY, SUGGESTING A VERY EXTENSIVE LARVAL DEVELOPMENT. ONCE ESTABLISHED IN THE INTERTIDAL ZONE, YOUNG RECRUITS WILL DEVELOP TO MATURE INDIVIDUALS IN LATE SPRING, WHEN MOLTING CRABS BECOME SCARCE AND PROPORTION OF BREEDING FEMALES INCREASES.

1703;SCHWAMBORN R, 1999, ARCH FISH MAR RES-a;1999;STABLE ISOTOPE COMPOSITION OF PARTICULATE ORGANIC MATTER AND ZOOPLANKTON IN NORTH-EAST BRAZILIAN SHELF WATERS;NA;PARTICULATE ORGANIC MATTER (POM) AND ZOOPLANKTON (> 300 MU M) WERE SAMPLED AT 15 STATIONS ALONG FIVE TRANSECTS OFF NORTH-EASTERN BRAZIL DURING THE DRY SEASON. ADDITIONALLY, SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM THE ITAMARACA ESTUARINE SYSTEM (IES), NEAR RECIFE, FOR COMPARISON. THE DATA ON NATURALLY OCCURRING STABLE ISOTOPES SUGGEST THAT EXPORT OF POM FROM THE IES WAS RESTRICTED TO THE REEF LINE. THIS WAS EVIDENT BY A MAXIMUM OF DELTA(13)C ON THE INSHORE SHELF (APP. 6 TO 15 KM OFFSHORE). THERE WAS NO MEASURABLE ESTUARINE INFLUENCE ON DELTA(13)C OF POM AND ZOOPLANKTON ON THE SHELF. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN DELTA(13)C AND DELTA(15)N BETWEEN THE SAMPLES TAKEN AT SHELF STATIONS OFF PERNAMBUCO AND CEARA STATES, ALTHOUGH MANGROVE COVER IN PERNAMBUCO IS MORE THAN 10 TIMES HIGHER THAN IN CEARA. DELTA(13)C VALUES OF SHELF ZOOPLANKTON VARIED BETWEEN -19.8 AND -16.3 PARTS PER THOUSAND PDB. THE DIFFERENCE IN DELTA(13)C BETWEEN ZOOPLANKTON AND POM WAS 4.2 +/- 1.8 PARTS PER THOUSAND. DECAPOD CRUSTACEAN LARVAE SHOWED DELTA(13)C VALUES BETWEEN -19.8 AND -17.2 PARTS PER THOUSAND PDB. COPEPODS HAD DELTA(13)C VALUES BETWEEN -19.5 AND -18.7 PARTS PER THOUSAND PDB. THE DIFFERENCES IN DELTA(13)C BETWEEN COPEPODS AND CHAETOGNATHS FOUND INSHORE AND OFFSHORE WERE 1.1 AND 1.0 PARTS PER THOUSAND PDB, RESPECTIVELY. AFTER ``C/N-CORRECTING'' DELTA(13)C VALUES, ZOOPLANKTON STILL HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER VALUES THAN POM. POM DELTA(15)N VARIED BETWEEN 1.6 AND 5.6 PARTS PER THOUSAND. ZOOPLANKTON WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN N-15 COMPARED WITH POM AT ESTUARINE AND SHELF STATIONS. THE DIFFERENCE IN DELTA(15)N WAS 3.2 PARTS PER THOUSAND. DECAPOD LARVAE SHOWED RELATIVELY LOW DELTA(15)N VALUES (SIMILAR TO OR EVEN LOWER THAN ZOOPLANKTON SUBSAMPLES), INDICATING A RELATIVELY LOW TROPHIC POSITION. DELTA(13)C VALUES OF DECAPOD LARVAE WERE GENERALLY CLOSE TO THE VALUES MEASURED FOR THE OCEANIC COPEPOD COMMUNITY INDICATING A SIMILARITY IN THE UTILIZATION OF PELAGIC PRIMARY CARBON SOURCES.;SCHWAMBORN R, 1999, ARCH FISH MAR RES-a;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

THIS STUDY, CONDUCTED IN AUSTRAL SUMMER FROM JANUARY 14TH TO 20TH, 1995, PRESENTS A FIRST INSIGHT INTO THE CURRENT REGIME, DISTRIBUTION OF WATER PROPERTIES AND MATERIAL EXCHANGE AT THE LAND-SEA INTERFACE OF THE ABROLHOS REEF SYSTEM. SPECIFIC TRACERS, SUCH AS PARTICLE MINERALOGY AND PHYTOPLANKTON PIGMENTS, WERE EMPLOYED TO DISCERN THE IMPACT OF MATERIAL SOURCES UPON THE SYSTEM. PATTERNS OF THE CURRENT REGIME AND WATER PROPERTIES WERE LARGELY CONTROLLED BY TOPOGRAPHY AND REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF DISTINCT INSHORE, COASTAL, OPEN REEF, AND INNER SHELF REALMS OF THE PELAGIC SYSTEM. THE INSHORE REALM WAS MESOTROPHIC WITH TYPICAL ESTUARINE PHYTOPLANKTON AND THE OTHERS, FED BY THE BRAZIL CURRENT, WERE OLIGOTROPHIC WITH OCEANIC PHYTO- AND ZOOPLANKTON. FORESHORE SHOALS, GOVERNED BY TERRIGENOUS RESUSPENDED MATERIAL, WERE THE MAIN SOURCE OF MATTER TO THE COASTAL REALM. THE SEAWARD TRANSPORT OF MATERIAL WAS HAMPERED BY A HYDRODYNAMIC BARRIER SET-UP BY STRONG SHORE-PARALLEL CURRENTS AND THE INNER ARE OF THE REEFS. LAND IMPACT UPON THE REEF WATERS WAS MITIGATED DUE TO EFFICIENT: FLUSHING BY THE BRAZIL CURRENT.;KNOPPERS B, 1999, ARCH FISH MAR RES;NA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ROCKS OF THE FOLD BELT ARE THRUST TO THE EAST AND DISPLAY INCREASING DEFORMATION AND METAMORPHISM WESTWARD. ALMOST ALL THE PHOSPHATE DEPOSITS ARE FOUND IN THE BRASILIA FOLD BELT, EITHER ALONG ITS BOUNDARY WITH THE CRATON OR IN EXTERNAL STRUCTURAL UNITS SHOWING POLYCYCLIC DEFORMATION AND GREEN-SCHIST METAMORPHISM. THEY OCCUR IN THE METASEDIMENTARY ROCKS OF THE MIDDLE PROTEROZOIC PARANOA GROUP AND IN THE UPPER PROTEROZOIC SAO FRANCISCO GROUP AND ITS EQUIVALENTS. MIDDLE PROTEROZOIC PHOSPHORITES ARE ECONOMICALLY THE MORE IMPORTANT, MOST ARE SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A STROMATOLITE REEF BARRIER. HOWEVER, THE ROCINHA-PATOS DE MINAS DEPOSIT, THE ONLY PRESENTLY MINED, IS LOCATED SOUTH OF THE REEF BARRIER. IT HAS DEVELOPED ON A SHALLOW TO DEEP RAMP BETWEEN A WIDE INTERNAL BASIN WITH REDUCED OXYGEN CONDITIONS AND LIMITED DETRITUS AND A MORE OXYGENATED MARINE ENVIRONMENT TO THE WEST. IN THE ROCINHA MINE, PHOSPHATE FORMS GRAINS, ANGULAR FRAGMENTS, LENSES, OR CENTIMETER-THICK BEDS IN SCHISTS AND CARBONATE OR GLAUCONITIC SCHISTS. THE P2O5 CONTENT OF PHOSPHATIC ROCKS RANGES BETWEEN 10 AND 15 PERCENT. ANNUAL PRODUCTION IS AROUND 200,000 TONS OF ORE CONTAINING 24 PERCENT P2O5. THE MINE AREA COMPRISES FOUR TECTONIC SLICES MADE UP OF SCHISTS, QUARTZOSCHISTS, AND PHOSPHATIC SCHISTS, SEPARATED BY SUBHORIZONTAL SHEAR PLANES. THESE ARE DEFINED BY TECTONIC BRECCIAS IN WHICH SECONDARY APATITE HAS RECRYSTALLIZED. THE MINE IS EXPOSED IN A 50 - TO 75-M PHOSPHATIC SEQUENCE WHICH IS REPEATED IN A LOWER SLICE ABOUT 100 M BELOW MINE LEVEL. THE PHOSPHATIC ORE IS A HOMOGENEOUS CRYPTO- TO MICROCRYSTALLINE APATITE IN FAIRLY CONTINUOUS CENTIMETER-THICK BEDS WHICH WERE STRETCHED, FRAGMENTED, AND BOUDINAGED DURING BRASILIANO ISOCLINAL FOLDING AND SUBSEQUENT SUBHORIZONTAL SHEARING. X-RAY DIFFRACTION, IR SPECTROMETRY, AND CHEMICAL ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT THE METASEDIMENTARY PHOSPHATE IS A WEAKLY CARBONATED FLUORAPATITE WITH LOW F AND CO2 CONTENTS. THE INFLUENCE OF THE BRASILIANO OROGENESIS IS MARKED BY PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION OF F BY OH. SECONDARY PRISMATIC APATITE, KAOLINITE COATINGS, AND WAVELLITE SHEAFLIKE STRUCTURES ARE PRODUCTS OF WEATHERING AND ARE FOUND IN MINE SECTIONS AND BORE HOLES TO A DEPTH OF 10 TO 15 M.
